Let start with the basics, the Cambridge dictionary defines data as:

> Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making

Notice that the definition says nothing about the way the information is structured. Data is just as likely to be unstructured (e.g. Social media posts, videos, images, charts, news articles, blog posts etc.) as it is to be structured (tables, spreadsheets etc.). In fact, more than **80 percent** of all data generated today is considered unstructured.

If you ask people within any type of organisation how they analyse their data, you'll probably get an answer pretty quick, and that answer is likely to be Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI etc. But, ask them how they analyse the news, and you'll probably get a confused look. Most companies have a process in place for the aggregation, analysis, and dissemination of their structured content (typically some form of data lake, analytics tool, and shared dashboards), but how many have solutions for the aggregation, analysis and sharing of news?
