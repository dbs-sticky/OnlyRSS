# About OnlyRSS
## In the beginning....
OnlyRSS started out as an RSS feed with no associated website. The articles only existed in the feed and they could only be accessed via RSS readers such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) and[Inoreader](http://inoreader.com/).

## ...then everything changed...
As I became increasingly interested in article design (layout, format, fonts etc.), I started to hand code articles in HTML and CSS, I then decided to create a unique style for each article, with the aim of becoming more competent in CSS each time I wrote\designed a new article.

## What about the RSS feed?
The RSS feed will continue, and will always contain the full article, so you never have to visit OnlyRSS to read an article (therefore avoiding the results of my CSS experiments).

## Subscribe
