                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Whether you work in data science, data analytics, finance, strategy, user experience, sales,
                    marketing, or product, at some point you will be creating data visualisations, either for use
                    externally (in your products and on social media), or internally (in your presentations and
                    reports). As an employee of an information and analytics company, it’s important that the
                    visualisations I choose reflect the same high standard as the underlying data, or at the very least,
                    don’t misrepresent the data.</p>
                <p>As a product manager, I’ve used a variety of tools over the years to create mock-ups. Some tools
                    output high-fidelity designs, but typically I’m dealing with high-level concepts that need to be
                    created quickly and updated often (based on user feedback). For these scenarios, I’ve recently
                    started using a free and open-source tool called <a href='https://excalidraw.com/'
                        target="_blank">Excalidraw</a> (see my blog post about <a
                        href='../posts/drawing-with-excalidraw.html' target="_blank">Drawing with Excalidraw</a>).</p>
                <p>During early 2021 I was managing the rebuild of one of my company&#39;s analytics tools, and the new
                    version required the extensive use of charts in order to visualise a wide variety of data, as usual,
                    I turned to Excalidraw to create the initial mock-ups. Before I knew it, I had amassed a large
                    number of basic chart types, so I turned these into an Excalidraw library and added my library to
                    the project in <a href='https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-libraries'
                        target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can download my library <a
                        href='https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?sort=default#dbssticky-data-viz'
                        target="_blank">here</a> (title: &#39;Data Viz&#39;, author: &#39;@dbs-sticky&#39;).</p>
                <p>I then decided to take my library of charts and generate a "chart picker" diagram. I based this off
                    an existing concept developed by Dr. Andrew Abela from <a href='https://extremepresentation.com/'
                        target="_blank">ExtremePresentations</a> (anyone interested in charting is probably already
                    familiar with this <a href='https://extremepresentation.com/design/7-charts/'
                        target="_blank">classic version</a>). I made some changes to Dr. Abela&#39;s design, mostly
                    around the Distribution section which I have expanded with more options. My diagram is designed to
                    help you choose a chart based on your data, and what you are trying to convey to the user. My
                    initial aim for creating this chart picker was to share it with my colleagues, I&#39;ve since shared
                    it publicly, and have now made it available on <a href='https://github.com/dbs-sticky/ChartPicker'
                        target="_blank">GitHub</a> for anyone to use or to improve upon.</p>
