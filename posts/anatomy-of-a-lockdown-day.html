      <h2>Prior to lockdown</h2>
      <p>Prior to lockdown, I used to work from 4 different locations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bishopsgate (round trip commute ≈ 3&nbsp;hours, car, train, tube, walk)
        </li>
        <li>Heathrow (round trip commute ≈ 2&nbsp;hours, car)</li>
        <li>Sutton (round trip commute ≈ 2.5–3.5&nbsp;hours, car)</li>
        <li>Home (0&nbsp;hours)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My start time each day was dependent upon which office I was working
        from, the earliest being when I was working from Sutton. To avoid the
        M25 traffic, I&#39;d wake at 5:30&#8239;am, leave home at 5:50&#8239;am and arrive at
        the office around 7&#8239;am.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a typical week, I was spending around
        <strong>11 hrs simply travelling to and from my place of work</strong>.
        And when I arrived at work, I was typically sitting at a desk in front
        of a laptop—a laptop that I&#39;d just carried with me from home.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a typical week I&#39;d work from each of the 4 locations at least
        once, so there was no real sense of a fixed routine.
      </p>

      <h2>During lockdown</h2>
      <p>
        During March 2020, when all employees in the UK were asked to work from
        home (if practical), this all changed. Being a Product Manager who was
        often in a different location as the teams I needed to work with e.g.
        Tech, Sales, Marketing, Data Science, Data engineering, etc., I was used
        to &quot;remote working&quot;, even when that meant being in one office,
        and connecting with teams in a different office.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;d also got into the habit of working from home at least once a
        week (usually when I had to focus on a task). So shifting to working
        from home full-time was not a big deal, and in many ways it was
        preferable (for a start, I was saving 11&nbsp;hours by not travelling).
      </p>
      <h3>A new routine</h3>
      <p>
        After a few months of working from home, I&#39;d found that my weekdays
        had settled into a repeating pattern that included: reading, working,
        eating, exercise, and TV. This is shown in the sketch below:
      </p>

            full size at Excalidraw.com</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I&#39;d start the day by getting up around 7am (I struggle to sleep past
        6am to be honest) and would read my Kindle for around an hour, then
        I&#39;d start work around 8:30&#8239;am. First thing I would do is check the
        news from the previous night via Feedly (I subscribe to around 120
        feeds). I&#39;d often have a small lunch at 11:30&#8239;am while at my desk,
        and then I&#39;d either go for a 5&#8239;km run or walk at midday (while
        listening to podcasts). Right after my lunch\exercise break I&#39;d
        check Feedly again, and then get back to work. At the end of the workday
        (around 5&#8239;pm) I&#39;d check Feedly one last time, and then I&#39;d be
        thinking about what to cook the family for dinner (we eat at 6&#8239;pm, which
        I guess is earlier than most.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After dinner I&#39;d read again, and then it would be time for my second
        exercise session of the day, typically a 10&#8239;km row on the Concept 2 which
        I&#39;d combine with watching TV. After that I&#39;d settle in front of
        the TV with the wife and we&#39;d watch a show that we both enjoy (so
        not the sci-fi I&#39;d typically watch while I row). At around 10&#8239;pm
        I&#39;d be off to bed, but would typically read again for up to an hour.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>
        I read around 45 books per year, mostly fiction, and mostly space
        operas, although recently I&#39;ve started to read more non-fiction.
        I&#39;d always struggled to read non-fiction, until I started reading in
        the mornings, I find that reading non-fiction in the morning, and
        fiction in the evenings really suits me, so it&#39;s something I&#39;m
        planning to continue.

      </p>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        I exercise for 2 hours per day. On the face of it this might seem like a
        lot—its not. When you consider that I&#39;m basically
        <strong>not moving for the other 22&nbsp;hours (sleeping or at my desk) then moving
          for 2&nbsp;hours each day actually doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s
          enough</strong>. And I think this is one of the most important things I&#39;ve learnt
        from working from home for almost a year. I no longer walk to the train,
        or from the tube to the office, or around the office, or go outside to
        buy my lunch. The only exercise I now do is via planned exercise
        sessions i.e. walking, running, or rowing. Apart from those activities,
        there&#39;s very little else I do that&#39;s burning calories. For this
        reason
        <strong>I&#39;d suggest that 2&nbsp;hours of exercise each day is probably a minimum
          for anyone who&#39;s working from home 5 days a week</strong>.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen once this pandemic is over.
        There&#39;s a lot of discussion about us never returning to the previous
        office routines, and I&#39;m all in favour of not going back to the old
        ways. Working from home suits me, and to be honest, I think it suits
        employers, as I think most employees are more productive (not to mention
        the costs my employer must be saving on office space and reduced
        travel).
