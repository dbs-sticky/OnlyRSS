        <h1>Copilot in Excel</h1>
          <p>
            The current integration of M365 Copilot into MS Excel is… messy. There are multiple ways to interact with Copilot, and it’s not always clear which one you should be using. This post is my attempt at understanding and documenting the various ways that M365 Copilot works with Excel.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I recently gave a presentation on how M365 Copilot integrates with Excel, and I thought it might be useful to share some of what I learnt as a blog post, not only because “sharing is caring”, but also because the situation was far more complicated than I had initially assumed.

        <h2>How to access the options listed above</h2>
        <h3>App Skills in Excel</h3>
          <p>
            This is available by selecting the drop-down arrow on the Copilot button (which is located on the far right of the Home ribbon) and then selecting App skills.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/copilot-app-skills.webp" width="835" height="683" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot Microsoft Excel, showing a dropdown menu under the 'Copilot' icon, with the option 'App Skills' selected.">
              <figcaption>
                The App Skills menu used to be the default action for the Copilot button. But since the M365 chat app has been brought into Excel, it's the chat app that's now the default. App Skills is now available via the dropdown menu.
              </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Once you've selected App Skills, you'll be presented with a side-panel on the right-hand side of the screen. This side-panel will contain a list of available App Skills, and you can select the one you want to use by clicking on it.
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="/images/copilot-app-skills-suggest-formula.webp" width="800" height="414" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot Microsoft Excel, The Copilot App Skills side-panel. The user has selected the option to suggest a formula, and Copilot has suggested a formula and asked the user if they wish to add the formula to the worksheet.">
                <figcaption>
                  In this example I've selected the first app skill from the list i.e. suggest a formula column. Copilot then proposes a formula, explains the formula to me, and then asks for permission to go ahead and implement the formula in the worksheet.
                </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The App Skills in Excel option is the <strong>only one (currently) that will edit the workbook directly using Excel's built in formulas and functions</strong>. But, be aware, one of the listed app skills is NOT like the others!
          </p>
        <h3>App Skills in Excel (Give a unique insight using Python)</h3>
          <p>
            The option to "Give a unique insight using Python" will NOT edit your workbook using Excel's built in functions and formulas, instead it will use Python to analyse your workbook and then present the results in a side-panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why this option is in this list, and not a separate item in the Copilot dropdown list is beyond me. But it is what it but, and I suspect this will change in the future.
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="/images/copilot-app-skills-python.webp" width="791" height="737" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot Microsoft Excel, The Copilot App Skills side-panel. The user has selected the option to suggest a formula, and Copilot has suggested a formula and asked the user if they wish to add the formula to the worksheet.">
                <figcaption>
                  The result of the Python analysis, if you are "Python curious", you can expand the "Show analysis" option and expose the underlying Python code.
                </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The Python code that is generated is not editable, and you can't use it to edit your workbook. The only thing you can do with this code is copy it to the clipboard, and then paste it into a Python environment (such as Visual Studio Code) to run it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the code can't be edited, and even though it's not using Excel's functions and formulas, it can still be quite useful. For example, the chart generated above was based on a worksheet that contained a years worth of commercial aircraft C-Checks and Heavy Check ground durations. The Python analysis decided that plotting the ground duration against aircraft age would be useful (which it is). It even added trendlines so that I can easily see the relationship between ground duration and aircraft age.
          </p>
        <h3>App Skills in Excel (Advanced Analysis)</h3>
          <p>
            By simply entering the following prompt: "Advanced analysis" you can trigger the Advanced Analysis mode of Copilot. This mode is similar to the "Give a unique insight using Python" mode, in that it will analyse your workbook using Python. The difference is that the results are presented in a new Python enabled Worksheet. And you have the option to edit the Python code that is generated.
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="/images/copilot-app-skills-advanced.webp" width="779" height="261" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot Microsoft Excel, The Copilot App Skills side-panel. The user has selected the option to suggest a formula, and Copilot has suggested a formula and asked the user if they wish to add the formula to the worksheet.">
                <figcaption>
                  Triggering Advanced Analysis mode by simply entering the prompt "Advanced analysis", and then selecting "start".
