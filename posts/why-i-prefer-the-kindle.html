      <h1>Why I prefer the Kindle</h1>
      <p>
        There's two reasons why I created this article: because I wanted to
        highlight some Kindle benefits that are often overlooked (probably
        because they are specific to me), and because I wanted to attempt some
        CSS that was a bit more "advanced" than my usual tweaks to the font and
        paragraph styles.
      </p>

      <p>
        My aim was to try and reproduce the Kindle Oasis reading experience as
        best I could (given my limited knowledge of CSS).
      </p>
      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <p>
        Click <a href="#section-1"><strong>here</strong></a> to "open" the
        article on the Kindle, and then use the Kindle's Next/Previous buttons
        (on the right of the device) to navigate through the article.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the bottom of this page is a description of what I learnt while
        creating this blog post.

          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>
            I didn't used to read. Don't get me wrong, I had books, almost
            enough to fill a shelf (it was a mix of physics text books and a
            small but treasured collection of Calvin & Hobbes) but I wasn't "a
            reader". I didn't go to bed with a book, and picking up a book
            during the day was not part of my routine.
          </p>

          <p>
            This all changed about 7 years ago when I made a deal with a
            colleague, if she watched the TV show Firefly, then I'd read a book
            that she had recommended. I read that book on a Kindle, and I have
            barely put the Kindle down since. I'm not saying that I only kept up
            the habit of reading because of the Kindle, but I'm not sure I would
            have carried on if I had to order books, wait for them to arrive,
            and then struggle to read them in the dark while the wife tried to
            go to sleep next to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first device I bought was the Paperwhite, then I passed that
            onto the wife and I got a newer version of the Paperwhite, and a
            while later I bought an even newer generation Paperwhite, more
            recently I treated myself and upgraded to a Kindle Oasis.
          </p>
          <h1>benefits</h1>
          <h2>1 - The dictionary</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike Donald Trump, I don't <em>know all the words</em>, so being
            able to press my fingertip on a word and see the definition is
            great. Even more useful than the dictionary is the etymology, I find
            that learning how a word came to be helps me to remember its
            definition.
          </p>

        <section id="section-2">
          <button
            onClick="location.href='#section-3'"
            class="next-button"
            title="Next Page"
          ></button>
          <button
            onClick="location.href='#section-1'"
            class="previous-button"
            title="Previous Page"
          ></button>
          <h2>2 - The backlight</h2>
          <p>
            I mostly read in bed, and unlike my wife, I don't fall asleep as
            soon as my head hits the pillow, so the backlight on the Kindle is
            essential for me. On the Oasis as you can change the colour
            temperature and switch to dark mode (i.e. light text on a dark
            background, a feature I've attempted to replicate on this page via
            the Toogle Dark Mode button).
          </p>
          <h2>3 - The clock!</h2>
          <p>
            Ok, this one might seem a bit silly, but as I read when I go to bed,
            it's useful for me to keep an eye on the time, otherwise I might
            find myself reading well into the small hours. Like many people
            these days I don't have a clock in the bedroom as I rely on my
            phone. Having the clock on the Kindle stops me periodically reaching
            for my phone.
          </p>

          <h2>4 - Saving quotes</h2>
          <p>
            Not so important when reading fiction (which represents about 80% of
            what I read), but when I do venture into the world of non-fiction, I
            often like to save quotes or other useful sections of text so I can
            easily find them again later. This is a feature of the Kindle that
            often gets overlooked.
          </p>

          <h2>5 - Kindle Unlimited</h2>
          <p>
            Kindle Unlimited in the UK costs Â£7.99 pm and includes more than
            650,000 books that can be borrowed (up to 20 at a time). I'm
            probably reading 2-3 books per month via Kindle Unlimited, so for me
            it makes financial sense.

            onClick="location.href='#section-3'"
            class="next-button"
            title="Next Page"
          ></button>
          <button
            onClick="location.href='#section-2'"
            class="previous-button"
            title="Previous Page"
          ></button>
          <h2>6 - Whisper sync</h2>
          <p>
            This is Amazon's name for the feature that lets you sync your
            reading progress across Kindle devices and Kindle apps. When I find
            myself in the car waiting for one of my kids to finish [insert name
            of activity that seems really important to them now but they will
            quit once they become a teenager here], then I'll often fire up the
            Kindle app on my phone, and start reading where I'd finished off the
            night before.
          </p>
          <h2>7 - Space</h2>
          <p>
            You can fit more than 2,000 books on an 8GB Kindle, which is
            redonkulous. I typically have no more than 2 books downloaded to my
            device, the one I'm currently reading, and the one I'll be reading
            next. For those who don't like to hoard stuff in their homes (like
            me), a Kindle is a great space saver.

      <h2>What I learnt</h2>
      <h3>It's time to go back to formula</h3>
      <p>
        My CSS "skills" are far worse than I thought. I'm happy enough with the
        usual CSS required for defining the style of a typical article body
        (which is one of the main reasons why I started this blog), but when it
        comes to using CSS for layout, I really don't know what I'm doing.
        Creating the Kindle above with CSS was more the result of trial and
        error, than it was me actually knowing what I was doing. So I'll be
        looking out for some CSS layout tutorials in the near future.
      </p>
      <h3>Separating paragraphs</h3>
      <p>
        This article made me think about how paragraphs are visually
        distinguished from one another. I'm a fan of some extra whitespace
        between paragraphs, but, while trying to make the Kindle text look as
        authentic as possible, I realised that most of the Kindle books I've
        read have no extra vertical space between paragraphs, but rather, they
        indent the first line of each paragraph (which makes sense I guess, as
        it doesn't waste any vertical space, which is important on devices such
        as the eReaders).
      </p>
      <p>
        This wasn't new to me obviously, but what I hadn't noticed was that when
        indentation is used, it's usually omitted for the first paragraph in a
        section/chapter (this also makes sense, there's no paragraph directly
        above from which to be separated, and if the chapter heading is
        left-aligned, then both heading and the start of the paragraph are
        nicely aligned along the left margin, and we humans like stuff that is
        nicely aligned).
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I thought I would have to create a new paragraph class in CSS
        specifically for the first paragraph of each section, and then add the
        class manually, but it turns out that CSS has an easy solution for this.
      </p>
      <code> p + p { text-indent: 1.5em; } </code>
      <p>
        The "+" above means that the style (the text-indent in this example) is
        only applied to paragraphs directly proceeding other paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if you wanted to apply a specific style to the first
        paragraph only, i.e. the paragraph directly proceeding a heading e.g.
        Heading 1, then the CSS selector would be:
      </p>
      <code> h1 + p { ... } </code>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
