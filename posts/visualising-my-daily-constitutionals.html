        <h1>Visualising my daily constitutionals (walks)</h1>

            The result of my attempt to build a calendar heatmap from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JS. The heatmap visualises my daily walks in 2024.

        <h2>Calendar heatmaps</h2>
          <p>
            It's hard to think of another chart type that can show daily data over a 12-month period in such a small space as well as a calendar heatmap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calendar heatmaps allow you to glean: relative values between individual days, busiest days e.g. Mondays, weekends etc. (by looking at the rows), busiest weeks (by looking at the columns), and any trends throughout the year.
          </p>

        <h2>Building from scratch</h2>
          <p>
            My version below is based on the <a href="https://github.com/dbs-sticky" title="View the commit graph on my GitHub profile">GitHub commit calendar heatmap</a>. And like the GitHub version, you can hover over each cell to see the relevant data for that day, in my case, the date and distance walked.
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial version used a linear colour scale (specifically the brightness, referred to as “lightness” in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" title="Read about oklch on wikipedia">oklch colour space</a>), the problem I found was that the majority of my walks were ~5&#8239;km, but I had a single walk that was 50&#8239;km. The result was one very bright cell, with the rest all pretty much the same dull shade of green.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then decided to use a logarithmic scale for brightness, and this worked much better. The logarithmic scale allowed the short (5–10&#8239;km) walks to remain visible, and the differences between them to be discernible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue now was that the long walks were too similar to each other in brightness e.g. my 50&#8239;km walk looked almost the same brightness as my 20&#8239;km walk. So, I decided to bring in a second parameter i.e. a drop-shadow. The spread of the drop-shadow  increases (linearly) with the distance walked, specifically, each 10&#8239;km walked adds 1 pixel of spread to the shadow. The result is an “overspill” effect, reminiscent of an old CRT display.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an aside, I noticed that the overspill was appearing behind adjacent cells, so I set the z-index of each cell to be equal to the distance walked, so brighter cells are always on a layer above less bright cells.
          </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            I really like the way this one has turned out—especially the overspill effect. But, I'm far less happy with the code itself. I was about 90% of the way through building it—struggling to align the day and month labels—when I realised that I should have simply used a HTML table, rather than CSS Grid & Flex.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see the code over at <a href="https://codepen.io/dbssticky/pen/raBWoRm" title="View the code at CodePen">CodePen</a>.

            <i>Update (24<sup>th</sup> Dec)</i>: After posting the article above, a friend of mine pointed out a calendar heatmap used by the Smashrun website (a running analytics site).
          <p>
          <p>
          They have a <a href="https://blog.smashrun.com/2020/07/09/a-better-calendar-view/" title="Visit the Smashrun blog">great blog post</a> that describes the thinking behind their implementation of a calendar heatmap. No “overspilling cells” in their solution, they use various coloured symbols to handle the outlying values.
