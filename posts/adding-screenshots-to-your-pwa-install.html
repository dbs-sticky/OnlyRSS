    <!--introduction-->
    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>During February 2022 OnlyRSS.org became a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA). The plan
        wasn’t really for anyone to install OnlyRSS on their mobile or desktop, it was for me to understand what was
        required to turn a website into a PWA—and the best way for me to understand that was to do it.</p>
      <p>The Google Play and Apple App store are great places to discover new apps, and once you find an app that might
        be useful, you get to read a description and view some screenshots of the app before you decide to install.
        There is no convenient store for PWAs, so initial discoverability is still an issue. But, once a visitor does
        happen upon your PWA enabled website, and is prompted to install your PWA, there is now a solution for providing
        the visitor with screenshots and a description. And all that’s required is a few new entries in the existing
        manifest file.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Solution-->
    <section>
      <h2>New manifest file entries</h2>
      <p>Below you can see the required entries in the manifest file for the screenshots and description. Webp images
        are supported, so after capturing suitable screenshots, I’d recommend using a tool such as <a
          href="https://compress-or-die.com/webp">CompressOrDie</a> to convert them to webp, and then compress them as
        best you can without degrading the quality too much (my images are ≈40&#8239;KB each).</p>

    </section>

    <!--result - section-->
    <section>
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>Once the new manifest entries have been added, when a visitor accesses your website on Chrome on Android (or
        Samsung Internet on Samsung devices), in addition to being prompted to install your PWA, they will have the
        option to swipe-up on the install prompt and view your app description and screenshots [<span
          class="fig-ref">fig.&nbsp;1</span>]. The visitor can tap on the screenshots and view them full size.</p>

      <h2>Compatibility</h2>
      <p>According to<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/screenshots#browser_compatibility">
          mdn web
          docs</a>, app screenshots are supported in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Edge on Desktop (≥88),</li>
        <li>Chrome on Android (≥88), and</li>
        <li>Samsung Internet on mobile(≥15.0).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’ve tested them on Android, where they work as advertised, <strong>but I had no luck getting them to work on
          Windows with Edge</strong>. I added additional screenshots to the manifest and set the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/screenshots#browser_compatibility:~:text=The%20platform%20member%20can,specific%20application%20distribution%20platforms.">
          ‘platform’ member</a> to both ‘wide’, and ‘windows’, and neither resulted in the screenshots (or
        description) being visible. I’ve left those entries in my manifest file (in the hope that Edge/Chrome will
        support them in future), they can be seen under the <a href="../manifest.json">screenshots section of my
          manifest file</a>.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        Adding screenshots and a description to your PWA is yet one more step in moving your app away from being “just
        a website” and towards being an “application”. It’s easy to implement, and improves the installation
        experience for Android (and Samsung) visitors on mobile. I also suspect that in future, these app screenshots
        and description will start to surface in web search results (alongside an install prompt), and maybe even in
        app stores&#8239;&#129310;.
