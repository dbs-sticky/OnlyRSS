      <!--MARK: Why Product Managers need to embrace the tech-->
      <p>
        After 16 years as a Product Manager, I share my thoughts on why
        technical knowledge is crucial for product management success.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <!--MARK:Background-->
    <p>
      I’ve been a Product Manager for 16 years. I don’t mean I’ve worked
      <em>in</em> product management for 16 years, I mean I’ve literally had
      the Individual Contributor (IC) role of Product Manager (PM) for 16
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does this mean I lack the skills required to become a Director-, VP-, or
      Chief-of-Product? No idea, it’s never occurred to me to apply for any of
      those roles. Is it just a lack of ambition then? The answer to that
      depends on how you define ambition. If you limit your definition of
      professional ambition to mean “taking on more responsibility”—which is
      business speak for “managing people”—then yes, I have no ambition. But,
      if your definition of ambition includes “trying to be as good as you can
      in your <em>current</em> role”, then I would consider myself to be very
      ambitious (surprise! I subscribe to the latter definition).
    </p>
    <p>
      If this all sounds like me trying to justify why I’ve had the same role
      for the last 16&nbsp;years, then I’ve done an effective job of writing
      my intro paragraphs, because that’s exactly what I was aiming for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of this is that I’ve developed some strong “opinions” on what
      it takes to be a good IC PM. But before I dive into what I’ve learned
      over the last 16&nbsp;years, here’s my definition of Product Management
      (it can mean different things in different organisations or industries).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <q>A PM listens to customers, understands their problems, and then uses
        his/her knowledge of the technology available to define and build*
        solutions.</q>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      *in many organisations, the PM role ends with the definition, which is a
      shame, the building bit is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a
      PM—it also helps that I’ve never met a software engineer I didn’t want
      to go to the pub with.
    </p>
    <p>
      While understanding customers is crucial, that ground has been
      well-covered by countless PM resources. Instead, I want to focus on an
      equally vital but often overlooked aspect of product management:
      technical knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>But that’s what engineers are for, right?</h2>
    <!--MARK: But that’s what engineers are for, right?-->
    <p>
      I like to compare being a PM to being an architect (of buildings, not
      software). Imagine you’re an architect who designs homes. You meet with
      the client, and you try and understand their unique situation e.g. Are
      they young or old? Do they enjoy entertaining or are they hermits? Do
      they have cats or dogs? Do they have (or plan to have) a large family?
      Do they enjoy gardening? Do they work from home? Do they own multiple
      cars? What’s their budget? When do they want to move in?
    </p>
    <p>
      These are important questions that need to be answered before an
      architect can begin the design process. The home has to be designed to
      meet the client’s needs, but it should also be designed so that it takes
      advantage of the latest building materials, can be constructed
      economically, and that once built, is easy to maintain. To do this the
      architect needs to be aware of trends and advances in engineering, in
      building materials, in building standards etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as an architect needs to understand construction materials and
      engineering principles, a PM needs knowledge of the technical tools and
      platforms available. Without this knowledge, we risk designing solutions
      that are impractical, inefficient, expensive, or even impossible to
      build.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, a PM must deeply understand not just the problem space
      (#obvs), but also <em>the solution space</em> to be truly effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      What follows is a description of the types of technologies I try to keep
      up with, and the methods I use to ensure that I do that efficiently.
      I’ve also thrown in a few examples of how keeping abreast of these
      technologies has benefited me, my products, and my users. One big
      caveat, I’m a PM for a data analytics company with a big focus on UI
      products that run in the browser. If you’re a PM for a company that
      makes
      <a href="https://www.equus.co.uk/collections/halloween-horse-riding">Halloween costumes for horses</a>, I’m sorry,
      this is not the blog post for you.
    </p>

    <h2>The tech & resources</h2>
    <!--MARK: The tech-->
    <h3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      Your tech stack might use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Your developers
      might be coding in C# on .Net or JavaScript on Node.js. But at the end
      of the day, when your users interact with your product in the browser,
      that browser is using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display your content.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTML is the language used to define the semantic structure and content
        of web pages, like the skeleton and text.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS is the language used to control the visual styling and layout,
        everything from colours and fonts to animations and responsive design.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript takes care of the user interactions, manipulating content
        dynamically, and communicating with servers, enabling everything from
        simple button clicks to complex single-page applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these 3 technologies is being constantly developed and updated,
      but it’s CSS that has probably been through the most rapid changes over
      the last few years. And many of the recent additions to the CSS spec can
      be implemented into your products to improve the experience for your users,
      but also to simplify the build effort i.e.&nbsp; reduce the time
      required by your developers.

    <h3>Browsers</h3>
    <!--MARK: Browsers & Dev Tools-->
    <p>
      Your product is going to be displayed to your users via a browser, and
      most likely one of the big 4 i.e. Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should keep up-to-date on the latest features of each, and also
      understand what they have in common, and what differentiates them. For
      example, across the 4 browsers mentioned, there’s actually only 3
      rendering engines used (the rendering engine interprets the HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript to display web pages). Chrome and Edge are both based on
      <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/">Chromium</a>, which uses the
      <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/">Blink</a> engine. Safari uses
      <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>, and Firefox uses
      <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/overview/gecko.html">Gecko</a>. But, on mobile Apple devices,
      whatever browser you install (Chrome,
      Firefox etc.) you’re actually just installing Safari wrapped in some
      Chrome/Firefox UI.

    <h3>Browser Dev Tools</h3>
    <!--MARK: Browser Dev Tools-->
    <p>
      The Dev Tools is a whole suite of developer focussed tools running in
      your browser that can be accessed by hitting the <kbd>F12</kbd> key on
      Windows (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on a Mac).
      These are incredibly powerful, and not just for developers. You can use
      them when doing some QA, to take full-page screenshots, and even to edit
      live web pages (very useful when you want to try out some changes you're
      considering to the content or UI).
    </p>
    <p>
      Much like the browsers themselves, the Dev Tools are also updated
      frequently with new features, and it’s worthwhile knowing what new
      capabilities are available.

    <!--MARK: Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android-->
    <p>
      So, all our apps are rendered using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then
      displayed via Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox. But, those browsers are
      most likely going to be running on Windows, Mac, iOS or Android. And the
      browsers are quite well integrated into the OS, so an app running in
      Chrome on Windows won’t necessarily render your product the same as
      Chrome running on a Mac.

      If the product you manage has an export capability, then the chances are
      that the exported data is going to end up in MS Office. If it's
      unstructured data then it's likely to be imported into Word or PowerPoint,
      if it's structured data then it's likely to be end up in Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      By keeping up-to-date with the features of these products you can ensure
      that your products' exports are compatible with the products included in
      M365 (including Copilot). You can even advise your users on how best to
      derive maximum value from the data you provide them when using MS Office

    <h3>The Web Share API</h3>
    <!--MARK: The Web Share API-->
    <p>
      I recently discovered the
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-share/">Web Share API</a> (via
      <a href="https://christianheilmann.com/2024/11/16/whats-your-excuse-for-not-using-the-web-share-api/">this blog
        post</a>), a powerful tool that bridges JavaScript, browsers, and operating
      systems. Not only will it provide my users with an enhanced sharing
      experience, but it will also significantly reduce our research,
      development, and maintenance workload.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than having to research the most common sharing destinations e.g.
      Facebook, X, LinkedIn, WeChat etc., used by my clients, and then define,
      build, and maintain those options—and probably sacrifice the less
      popular ones. The Web Share API simply invokes the Operating Systems’
      native sharing menu (yes, apparently this is a thing that exists!).
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is that the user will see only the options for the apps they
      have installed. This even includes the people the user most
      frequently/recently shares content with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screenshot below is taken from invoking the share option on this
      website, and it’s an example of what a Windows user (in this case, me)
      would see.

    <p>
      There is one caveat however, the Web Share API is not supported on
      Firefox (what’s even more unfortunate is that “it’s not supported on
      Firefox”is something I find myself uttering far too frequently).
    </p>

    <h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
    <!--MARK: Progressive Web Apps-->
    <p>
      Much like the Web Share API,
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">Progressive Web Apps</a>
      (PWAs) require very little effort to implement, but can greatly improve
      the users’ experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      With very little development effort, you can allow your users to
      “install” your web application on their OS (desktop or mobile). Your app
      will get a dedicated launch icon, a splash screen, and no
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/browser-and-gui-chrome/">browser chrome</a>. On mobile your app will
      fill the screen, just like a native
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once installed, as far as the user is concerned your app will look and
      behave like a native Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android application—PWAs even
      support offline capabilities and push notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screenshot below is of this blog, which has been implemented as a
      PWA.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/pwa.webp" alt="image-20250216160322895" /></p>
    <p>
      There is one caveat however, Firefox dropped their support for PWAs in
      2021. A decision that has angered and perplexed developers and users
      alike. The good news is that PWAs are a
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>.
      If the user’s browser supports PWAs, then that’s great, if it
      doesn’t, then there’s no downside. Your app will continue to run in the
      browser as usual.

    <h3>Python & Copilot in Excel</h3>
    <!--MARK: Python & Copilot in Excel-->
    <p>
      I’ve been waiting for this update to Excel for months (I subscribe to
      the MS Office roadmap updates via RSS), and only recently (Jan 2025) got
      access. MacOS users will have to wait until March.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of Python and M365 Copilot in Excel means that Excel
      users can now use natural language to analyse and visualise data in
      Excel with the full power of Python—no knowledge of coding in Python
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, the jitter chart shown below (which is a replication of
      one available from within one of my products) can be created with Python
      in Excel with just a few prompts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve mentioned this game-changing Excel update to a few colleagues (all
      of whom use Excel), and none were aware of its existence.

    <h3>Dev Tools</h3>
    <!--MARK: Dev Tools-->
    <p>
      Here’s the description of the Chrome Dev Tools (other browsers have
      their own version of dev tools) taken directly from the
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools">Dev Tools website</a>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <q>Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into
        the Google Chrome browser. DevTools lets you
        <mark>edit pages on-the-fly</mark> and diagnose problems quickly,
        which helps you build better websites, faster.</q>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I’ve highlighted one specific section of the description, because for
      Product Managers I think it’s really useful. It’s really easy to use the
      Dev Tools to edit the text on a webpage, and if you know some HTML &
      CSS, you can even make more fundamental changes to the page. This can be
      useful if you want to add a ticket to your backlog asking for small
      changes. Rather than trying to describe what you want (which could be
      misinterpreted) simply make the change to the live page and capture a
      screenshot—there’s even a screenshot tool built into Dev Tools (it even
      lets you capture a full page screenshot, including any of the page
      currently below the bottom of the viewport.)

    <h3>CSS one-liners</h3>
    <!--MARK: CSS one-liners-->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>scrollbar-gutter: stable</code> This will stop horizontal
          content shift when moving between pages that require/don’t-require a
          vertical scrollbar. Or when you open a modal/popup. See this in
          action in this
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFhPGfLfSa8">YouTube Short</a>
          from

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>@view-transition {navigation: auto;}</code> This one line of
          CSS will add a subtle fade effect when your users navigate between
          pages. When combined with an app running as a PWA on mobile, this
          gives your application a much more native feel. I learnt about View
          Transitions from an
          <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/566/#t=06:14">episode</a> of the
          <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show podcast</a>. You
          can also visit my own
          <a href="https://onlyrss.org/posts/view-transitions.html">blog post</a>
          that covers both versions of View Transitions i.e. same-document and
          cross-document.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>p{text-wrap: pretty;}</code> This single line will improve
          your application’s typography by removing widows &amp; orphans. i.e.
          single words that stand alone at the end of a paragraph or text
          block. You can see this in action in this
          <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-text-wrap-pretty">Chrome for developer blog post</a>

          <code>font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;</code> If you have tables
          with columns that contain only numeric data (that represent
          quantities or an order/position), then please use a font that
          supports tabular numbers, and ensure that font’s
          <code>tabular-nums</code> feature is enabled (yes, fonts have
          features!). To understand why this is important, see this
