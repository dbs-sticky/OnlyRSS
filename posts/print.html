  <h2>Indents</h2>

  <p>
    While writing my Kindle post last week, it made me think about how
    paragraphs are typically visually distinguished from one another in print,
    and on the web. That led me to look into how various paragraph spacing
    solutions can be implemented with CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the web, where an article is typically presented as one long page of
    text, essentially giving the author access to infinite vertical space,
    paragraphs are typically separated by some extra whitespace. But, in print,
    and on eReader devices, where content is presented on pages of fixed
    vertical height, paragraphs tend to be separated by simply indenting the
    first line. This results in more text on a single page when compared to
    adding whitespace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strictly speaking, this indentation is only necessary for paragraphs that
    directly follow another paragraph. No indentation is required when a
    paragraph follows a heading, sub header, figure etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily, there exists a CSS Selector specifically designed to target an
    element that directly follows another element, i.e. the "+" selector. And as
    we need to only target paragraphs that follow other paragraphs, we simply
    use:
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    <p>p + p {text-indent: 2.3em;}</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Drop Caps</h2>
  <p>
    As with the example above, start by setting the float, line-height,
    font-size, and font-family properties. Save for the float property, which
    must be set to left, you can use different property values. The example
    below uses pixels instead of em units and percentage values, for example,
    and opts for the Montserrat font. Note: it also changes the default
    font-size of the paragraph from 16px to 14px.
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    <p>h2 + p:first-letter {</p>
    <p>float: left;</p>
    <p>font-size: 2.3rem;</p>
    <p>line-height: 1;</p>
    <p>margin: 0 0.1em 0 -0.1em;</p>
    <p>padding: 0.1em;</p>
    <p>}</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now let’s say you want to change the color and add a border around your drop
    cap. To do so, you simply set the color property to whatever hex color code
    you want. We’ll use a nice purple below.
