              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>
                I hadn't written an article for quite some time, so decided to write about the new View Transitions feature that has been added to Google Chrome. I actually implemented View Transitions about 6&nbsp;months ago on this site, and I couldn't remember why I hadn't already written about it. Then, during my research, I came across Dave Rupert's blog post "<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/" title="Read 'Getting started with View Transitions' on Dave's blog" target="_blank">Getting started with View Transitions</a>" and then I remembered why. Dave's post covered everything I wanted to say, and he'd done a much better job of explaining it than I could have.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, it's such a cool little feature, and so easy to implement, that I decided to write about it anyway. And let's be honest, the web can't have too many cool animated GIFs, can it?

          <p>
            If not, then please visit the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-text-wrap-balance/" title="view the full explanation at the Chrome dev blog">Chrome dev blog</a> for the full details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, it's a way to "balance" titles, headings, and short paragraphs such that there are a similar number of words per line (and hence avoid widowed words). For simplicity, I'm going to refer to it as <em>CSS Balance</em> from now on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not going to repeat the information that's available on the Chrome dev blog, the aim of this article is to demonstrate the effect of using CSS Balance on a typical blog, specifically this blog. Basically, I'm going to show some examples so you can decide if it's something you should implement on your website.
          </p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Examples</h2>
          <p>
            The following examples have not been configured specifically to demonstrate the effects of CSS Balance, they are simply the result of enabling CSS Balance on titles and headings on this website.
          </p>
          <h3>Homepage cards</h3>
          <p>
            Figure 1 below shows the first 3 cards from my homepage. Figure 2 shows the same 3 cards but with CSS Balance enabled.
          </p>

        <p>
          As you can see, CSS Balance has had an effect on the titles of all 3 cards. The effect is probably most beneficial on the first card, where the words "Product" and "Manager" belong together, and on the second card, where the words "progress" and "bars" benefit from being together.
        </p>
        <p>
           In total, 13 out of the 22 homepage cards have multiline titles, and each one of those multiline titles was altered when CSS Balance was enabled. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Where CSS Balance is probably most beneficial is in stopping scenarios like that shown below in Figure 3, i.e. where a single number has appeared on a line by itself. Although to be fair, a non-breaking space should probably have been used in this scenario to keep "Windows" and "10" together.
        </p>



      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          So, should you enable CSS Balance on your website? Yeah, why not, it's literally 1 line of CSS. It's easy to enable it for your website (you'll need to try it in a canary build of Google Chrome) and then see if you like the effects. I'll be leaving it enabled on onlyrss.org, and will wait for browsers to add support.
