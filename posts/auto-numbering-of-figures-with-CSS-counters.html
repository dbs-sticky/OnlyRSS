    <!--introduction-->
    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>For the first 13&nbsp;years of my career I worked as a research scientist for the Defence Evaluation and
        Research Agency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Evaluation_and_Research_Agency">DERA</a>, an
        agency of the UK’s MoD). I worked on 3–5&nbsp;year projects covering a wide range of subjects. Even though the
        projects varied, they did all have one thing in common, i.e. one of the deliverables was always a report, and
        much like the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fy3rjQGc6lA">infamous TPS reports from Office Space</a>, the DERA
        reports also had to adhere to a strict format.</p>
      <p>One of those strict formats related to numbering, not just numbering of chapters, but sections, paragraphs,
        figures, and list items. Depending on how the document was structured, it was not unusual to have a list item
        with a number such as 2.1.2.15. Don’t get me wrong, this convention was actually useful, if you were on page 50
        and wanted to reference an item on page 5, the numbering made a lot of sense.</p>
      <p>As useful as numbering was for those DERA reports, it’s not something I find myself missing when writing a blog
        post. But, I do still find myself numbering figures in blog posts, this is useful as I often reference the
        figures from within the body text.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has written a long report that requires any form of numbering knows that it’s not something you
        should attempt to do manually—it has to be automated—otherwise you’ll find yourself updating all the following
        chapters/sections/paragraphs etc. each time you insert a new one into the middle of the document.</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>There’s no solution for this in HTML/CSS that’s as convenient as the numbering and cross-referencing that’s
        part of <a
          href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-cross-reference-300b208c-e45a-487a-880b-a02767d9774b">Microsoft
          Word</a>, but, there is a CSS solution that can at least handle the numbering part (but not the
        cross-referencing), and that solution is based on CSS Counters.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Counter_Styles/Using_CSS_counters">
        CSS Counters are, in essence, variables maintained by CSS whose values may be incremented or decremented by CSS
        rules that track how many times they’re used.<p>Source: mdn web docs</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To see a full description of CSS Counters and how they can be used, visit the CSS Counters page over at <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Counter_Styles/Using_CSS_counters">mdn web
          docs</a>. The use of CSS Counters below deals only with counting figures and displaying that count within the
        figure’s caption i.e. the figcaption HTML element.</p>
      <h3>Set the counter to zero</h3>
      <p>First, we define a counter called ‘figures’, and we set it to zero (it defaults to zero when reset), this goes
        in the body CSS declaration:</p>
      <pre><code>body {counter-reset: figures;}</code></pre>
      <h3>Increment the counter</h3>
      <p>Then, we increment the counter for each figcaption element that’s in the page, this goes in the figcaption CSS
        declaration:</p>
      <pre><code>figcaption {counter-increment: figures;}</code></pre>
      <h3>Display the current count</h3>
      <p>Lastly, we display the current count of figcaptions within the figcaption CSS declaration. We do this by using
        the ::before pseudo selector. We place the figcaption count between the text “Figure” and “.”, so we end up with
        something like “Figure 5.”:</p>
      <pre><code>figcaption::before {content: 'Figure ' counter(figures) '. ';}</code></pre>
      <h2>Implementation example</h2>
      <p>The code below shows the CSS used on OnlyRSS.org to display figcaptions, and the HTML used to generate
        figures 1 & 2.</p>
      <figure>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/dbs-sticky/087c723dad39056686bb32b41de0ce5b.js"></script>
        <figcaption>The CSS used on OnlyRSS.org to automatically number all figures.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/dbs-sticky/73f2ad2a6a10b060ed4b47d47f2c876d.js"></script>
        <figcaption>The HTML used on this page to display figures 1 & 2.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You’ll notice from figure 2 above that the figcaption HTML elements do NOT include the text “Figure 1.” or
        “Figure 2.”, yet they are both visible in the figures’ captions.</p>

    <!--Issues-->
    <section>
      <h2>Issues with this solution</h2>
      <p>Although the solution described above provides an easy method for automatically numbering figures within a page
        (actually, across all figures on a site that share the same style sheet,) it does have a few drawbacks:
      </p>
      <h3>Cross-referencing</h3>
      <p>One of the main reasons for numbering figures is so they can easily be referenced from within the article body
        e.g. “as you can see in figure 5”. Although adding new figures into the article will not require you to manually
        update the figure numbers, you will still have to update any cross-references, as there’s no link between the
        figure number and the cross-reference</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Although this solution automatically adds “Figure #” in your figcaptions, it’s important to note that anything
        added via the ::before or ::after pseudo selectors is NOT guaranteed to be available for reading aloud by screen
        readers (if you try and select the figcaption text above you’ll notice that “Figure 1”. cannot be selected.)
        But, I’ve read a couple of articles recently (<a
          href="https://jhalabi.com/blog/before-after-accessibility">here</a> and <a
          href="https://uselessdivs.com/blog/the-effect-of-css-on-screen-readers">here</a>) that seem to suggest that
        the majority of popular screen readers do in fact read ::before and ::after elements, even though they are not
        part of the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.</p>
      <h3>RSS aggregators e.g. Feedly, Inoreader etc.</h3>
      <p>RSS aggregators won’t be using your CSS to display the article content from your RSS feed, so anything added by
        your CSS isn’t going to appear when your articles are viewed in those apps.</p>
