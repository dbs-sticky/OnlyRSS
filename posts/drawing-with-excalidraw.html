        <p>Excalidraw is a great tool for quickly creating UI mock-ups, it also includes access to user generated

      <!-- Intro - section -->
      <h2>Excaliwhatnow?</h2>
      <p>Excalidraw is described by its creators as a <q>Virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like
          diagrams</q>.
        I’d describe it slightly differently, I think I’d go with <q>a drawing tool that’s so easy to use that
          you
          spend your time making sure the drawing is effective, rather than ‘pixel-fiddling’</q>.
      </p>
      <p>Excalidraw is great for quickly creating diagrams (you can see lots of great examples on the bottom
        of <a target="blank" href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/one-year-of-excalidraw/">this page</a>),
        but it can be used for “sketch” style drawings, like the drawing below of my rowing setup.</p>

      <p>Some of Excalidraw’s features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>runs in the browser</li>
        <li>supports real-time collaboration</li>
        <li>supports multiple export formats</li>
        <li>is secure (end-to-end encrypted)</li>
        <li>is vector based (so scales to all sizes)</li>
        <li>is very easy to learn (no “learning” required)</li>
        <li>is open source</li>
        <li>is free to use</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- How I use it -->
    <section>
      <h2>How I use it</h2>
      <p>As a Product Manager, I’m often having to define what apps look like, how they’re structured, what
        components they include etc. and I used to do this using hi-fidelity mock-up tools such as AxureRP
        (or
        even Adobe illustrator!). And to be honest, I wasted a lot of time obsessing over the size, colour
        and
        exact location of various page components. Once my company got serious about UX and started
        embedding
        dedicated UX resource within our squads, then it was no longer my responsibility to make my mock-ups
        pixel perfect.</p>
      <p> This is where Excalidraw really shines (it’s hard to be pixel perfect when there are no straight
        lines!), as its focus is on a “hand-drawn” aesthetic, it lends itself well towards the creation of
        “quick-and-dirty” sketches where the focus is to portray an idea or concept, rather than to
        represent a
        final pixel perfect design. Sketches can be created and altered quickly, and all from within a
        browser
        (important for those of us who work for large corporations and don’t have the admin rights required
        to
        install apps on our PCs).</p>
      <p>The mock-up below of a news search page took about 15&#8239;mins to produce, but the sketch does
        highlight
        quite
        a few important features about the search page concept.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="/images/drawing-with-excalidraw-2.webp" width="749" height="523" loading="lazy"
          alt="A sketch style mockup of a typical search results page, the images includes annotations which point to various elements within the mockup.">
        <figcaption>A search results mock-up page created in Excalidraw (<a href="/images/drawing-with-excalidraw-2.svg"
            target="_blank">view full size</a>).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> In addition to using it at work for mock-ups, it’s also my go-to drawing app for this blog, as you
        can
        see in my post about my <a href="anatomy-of-a-lockdown-day.html"> lockdown days</a>.</p>

    <!-- Libraries - section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Libraries make creating diagrams even quicker</h2>
      <p>As I’ve mentioned, one of the benefits of Excalidraw is the speed, but the existence of a small (but
        growing) community of users who share their <a href="https://libraries.excalidraw.com/"
          target="_blank">Libraries</a>
        makes it even faster to create diagrams.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion - section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>I really can’t recommend Excalidraw strongly enough, it’s a great tool, built and maintained by a
        group
        of enthusiastic developers who are actively engaging with their users. But, the only way to see how
        good
        it really is, is to <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">go and sketch something :-)</a></p>
