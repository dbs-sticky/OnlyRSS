        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          To celebrate our 20<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary the wife and I spent two weeks in Canada during late September 2023. We flew into Vancouver and then drove to Whistler, Clearwater, Jasper, Banff, and finished in Calgary. The scenery was breathtaking and the weather was perfect. The following image gallery is a selection of my favourite photographs from the trip.
