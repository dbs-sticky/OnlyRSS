      <h1>Do Brits hate Serifs?</h1>
      <p>
        Around a year ago I noticed that the BBC news site had updated their article format—and I really liked the new look. But, I then realised that I had my VPN on and was actually seeing the site as viewed from the US! Have our colonial cousins evolved so much during our split 400 years ago that they now have a better appreciation of typography?

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        It's perfectly normal for news websites to have different layouts and styles. Image and paragraph width, choice of typeface (Serif vs Sans-Serif), use of colours, horizontal page-alignment, position of the byline, location of the search field etc. All these features differ between news publishers, but, they are typically consistent within a single publisher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from consistency providing the reader with a more user friendly experience, it also helps to build brand recognition, and, maybe even more importantly (at least from a cost point-of-view), it's simpler to design, build, and support one solution than it is two, especially when you consider that many of the choices are subjective. For example, does it really matter if the byline is above or below the header image?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why I'm confused as to why the BBC News site went to the trouble of creating a different design for its international audience. I understand that differences around content were required (due to rights issues etc.) and that some layout changes would be required (as the international version is ad-supported), but why change the typography, layout, colours etc.?

    <h2>Page Layout</h2>
    <p>In the image below you can use the slider to compare the UK version with the international version. I guess we (in the UK) like colour, and the rest of the world…&nbsp;doesn't?
