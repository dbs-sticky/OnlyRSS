        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I recently wrote about my
          <a href="../posts/anatomy-of-a-lockdown-day.html">
            weekday lockdown routine</a>. In this article I'll be describing the hardware I use to do my
          job while working from home. As a Product Manager for a suite of
          News and Data Analytics products, I use the tools that most office
          workers are familiar with, i.e. Office 365 apps, but I'm also often
          sketching UIs, writing requirements in Confluence, or using tools
          such as PowerBI etc. to analyse and visualise large datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          My PC is located in a bay window at one end of my kitchen diner,
          it's used by the whole family, and is always on. When I'm working
          from home I use my work laptop via a docking station and a
          keyboard\mouse switch, switching between work and home computers
          only requires the push of a couple of buttons.

      <!-- hardware setup section-->
      <section>
        <h2>The setup</h2>
        <p>Here&#39;s my WFH components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 x Dell U2715H monitors (27&quot; 2560x1440)</li>
          <li>Logitech C920 HD webcam</li>
          <li>Logitech MX Master mouse</li>
          <li>TerraMaster F2-421 NAS (2x4GB raid 1)</li>
          <li>Keychron K2 keyboard (with Red switches)</li>
          <li>Ikea Bekant desk (160x80cm)</li>
          <li>Dell D6000 Universal dock*</li>
          <li>Dell Latitude 7490 laptop*</li>
          <li>Plantronics C520 headset*</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>*provided by employer</em></p>
        <p>
          The setup is connected to a 300Mbps (down) and 40Mbps (up) Broadband
          connection
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.fast">(g.fast)</a> via
          Gigabit Ethernet.

      <!-- Outputs section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <h3>Monitors</h3>
        <p>
          If you are using a laptop when WFH and have NOT got it connected to
          an external monitor, for the love of God please just stop right now,
          go on Amazon, buy a new monitor (or two) and do not return to your
          laptop until after the new monitor arrives. There are lots of good
          ways to save money in life, not buying a decent monitor is not one
          of them!
          <strong>You are staring at your monitor for more than 8hrs a day, this is
            not a component where you want to cut corners and
            &#39;make-do&#39;</strong>. Your employer should provide you with a suitable monitor, or
          reimburse you if you buy your own. If your employer does not believe
          a good monitor is worthwhile, then hold off on ordering a new
          monitor from Amazon, as your highest priority is finding a new
          employer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When deciding which monitor to choose, I&#39;d suggest that anything
          with a resolution of 2560x1440px. A width of 2560px means you can
          have 2 apps of 1280px side-by-side, and most apps run well at
          1280px. Your laptop display can be reserved for your more
          &quot;reference&quot; style apps, e.g. calendar, chat application,
          etc., while your main display is reserved for the apps required for
          your current task.
        </p>
        <h3>Speakers</h3>
        <p>
          My family don't need to hear what others are saying during my
          conference calls, so I use a wired headset. I know many people use
          Bluetooth headphones, and as good as modern Bluetooth is, I still
          find it less hassle to use a wire (wired headphones don't suddenly
          decide to connect to other devices when you're about to join a
          conference call).
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- inputs section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Inputs</h2>
        <h3>Mice</h3>
        <p>
          Again, not a component where you want to make compromises.
          <strong>I&#39;d recommend any of the Logitech mice in the
            <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/mx/master-series.html">MX Master series</a></strong>. They&#39;re
          geared towards productivity, and include enough
          useful features to make them good value for money. You don&#39;t
          have to get the latest version (the MX Master 3 retails for almost
          £100), the original version is often heavily discounted and
          sometimes dips below £50
          <a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/product/B00ULNAOMA">(view price history)</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
          Whereas the benefit of a good monitor and mouse are clear, the
          return on investment of a good quality keyboard is less clear.
          Keyboards come in 2 main flavours:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The &#39;rubber dome&#39; keyboards that you&#39;ll find on almost
            all office desks across the World, and the
          </li>
          <li>
            &#39;mechanical&#39; keyboards that you&#39;ll find on the desk of
            any discerning journalist, developer, or gamer.*
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <em>*and maybe on the desks of very discerning Product Managers
            :-)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          &#39;Mechanical&#39; and &#39;rubber dome&#39; here refer to the
          type of switches used for each key to register the key&#39;s
          actuation. You can buy a good &#39;rubber dome&#39; keyboard for
          less than £20. To get a good mechanical keyboard you&#39;re looking
          at at least £50, with serious mechanical keyboard enthusiasts (yes,
          it&#39;s a whole thing) spending £100+ on the keyboard itself, and
          then another £50+ on the keycaps (yes, that&#39;s also a whole
          thing). I have a mechanical keyboard on my desk, but I&#39;m not
          recommending anyone goes out and buys a mechanical keyboard. I&#39;d
          definitely put this component in the &#39;nice to have&#39; bucket.
        </p>
        <h3>Webcam</h3>
        <p>
          My wife and I both have the Logitech C920, this has been the &#39;go
          to&#39; HD webcam for streamers for many years now. When I bought
          mine back in 2018 I paid just £35...today they cost closer to £100.
          You can see how the price has changed for this particular webcam
          since February 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="../images/article4figure2.png"
          referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
          alt="article4image2"
          width="750"
          height="389"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Before spending money on a price inflated HD webcam, the first thing
          to try is to improve your lighting.
          <strong>There&#39;s no point having a good quality camera if you have a
            south facing window directly behind you</strong>. Shut the blinds, and pick up some LED lighting that can be
          mounted on top of the monitor. Maybe then consider a good webcam
          (after supply has caught up with demand).
        </p>
        <h3>Microphone</h3>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above, I use a headset, and it's not just becasue of
          Bluetooth issues. The best way to avoid background noise during
          conference calls is to use a dedicated headset with a mic, the mic
          is located right next to your mouth, and is unlikely to pick up
          other sounds from within your home. Bluetooth ear buds are great
          when you're out and about, or going for a run, and they are OK for
          the occasional call, but, if you are working from home on a regular
          basis, then you don't need to compromise. Get a dedicated wired
          headset, the other people on your call will thank you.

      <section>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <h3>Ethernet</h3>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to wire up the house with Ethernet (CAT6) in
          January 2020, just before the whole COVID-19 thing kicked off. At
          home I have number of bandwidth hungry stationary devices i.e. 3
          TVs, 2 desktop PCs, and a NAS. I also have a laptop (permanently on
          a desk), a Chromebook (that get&#39;s moved around a lot) and a very
          large number of IoT devices. As good as modern Wi-Fi is, it just
          doesn&#39;t have the same level of consistency that you get from
          Ethernet cable, and when you have 4 people potentially all on video
          calls at the same time, consistency is what you want.
          <strong>If it is at all practical, I would strongly recommend wiring up
            your home for Ethernet</strong>.

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          I realise that my setup might be considered &#39;overkill&#39;, but
          my thinking is simple, I&#39;m spending &gt;8hrs per day sitting at
          that desk, staring at those screens, tapping on that keyboard and
          shifting around that mouse, therefore it&#39;s worth putting some
          thought (and some money) into those components.
