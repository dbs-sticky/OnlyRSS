        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          "Zoom and enhance!" is a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zoom-and-enhance" target="_blank"> movie trope</a> that has long infuriated anyone who has even the most basic understanding of what is (and isn't) possible when manipulating images. In the past I often found myself shouting at the TV, “You can't recover information that was never there!”. It turns out that for movies and TV shows set before 2022 my outbursts were justified, but for those set during or after 2022, it's starting to look like I was very wrong.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Examples - section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>
          Below are 5 examples using my own family photographs that date between 1920 and 1979. Figures 1, 3, and 5 were originally black & white. While Figure 2 was originally colour, but the colour has degraded considerably and now has a very strong red cast. Figure 4 is a duotone. Each photo was digitised by scanning the original print (not the negative).
        </p>

        <p>You can enhance and colourise old photos.</p>
