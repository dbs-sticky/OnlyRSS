          <p>
            Ten examples of photos edited using the new Nano Banana model from Google Gemini. The key takeaway? Each example just required uploading an image to the Gemini app and typing a single prompt—no tech skills needed.

        <h2>Nano Banana</h2>
        <p>
          Nano Banana (officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) is an AI image generating and editing tool created by Google. It's the first AI image tool I've used that actually edits your original image, rather than creating a brand new one where key elements—like people's faces—are distorted beyond recognition.
        </p>
        <p>Android users can get Gemini from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.bard&pcampaignid=web_share" target="_blank">Play Store</a>. Apple users can get it from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729" target="_blank">App Store</a>.</p>

              Just add an image and a prompt, that's all you need to edit photos using the Nano Banana model in the Gemini app.

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>
          Below are 10 examples using my own photos. My favourite use-case is enhancing and colourising old family photos. I used to do this with Adobe Photoshop, but it was a long and tedious process. With Gemini, it's just a few clicks and a single prompt.
