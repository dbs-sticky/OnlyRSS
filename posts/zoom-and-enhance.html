            With modern off-the-shelf AI tools, it's now possible to bring old
            or degraded photos back to life by adding (or correcting) colour,
            and enhancing faces.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          "Zoom and enhance!" is a
          <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zoom-and-enhance">
            movie trope</a
          >
          that has long infuriated anyone who has even the most basic
          understanding of what is (and isn't) possible when manipulating
          images. In the past I often found myself shouting at the TV, “You
          can't recover information that was never there!”. It turns out that
          for movies and TV shows set before 2022 my outbursts were justified,
          but for those set during or after 2022, it's starting to look like I
          was very wrong.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          With recent advances in AI—especially with regard to image
          interpretation, manipulation, and generation—a few new tools have
          become available online that remove a lot of the skill that was
          previously required to enhance and colourise old black & white, or
          colour degraded photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below I provide links to 2 such AI tools and include 5 examples of old
          family photos that I've restored using them. I've also taken a recent
          colour photo, degraded it, and then used the same tools to see how the
          “restored” version compares with the unaltered original.

          <h2>Examples</h2>
          <p>
            Below are 5 examples using my own family photographs that date
            between 1920 and 1979. Figures 1, 3, and 5 were originally black &
            white. While Figure 2 was originally colour, but the colour has
            degraded considerably and now has a very strong red cast. Figure 4
            is a duotone. Each photo was digitised by scanning the original
            print (not the negative).

        <h2>Are the results “real”?</h2>
        <p>
          The results in the examples above look amazing, but are they real?
          i.e. are they an accurate representation of the original photos’
          subjects? We can't know for sure, as when restoring old photos the
          only source of truth we have are the old photos themselves. But what
          if we used a modern photo, removed the colour, and added a blur to the
          image in an attempt to make it look old? How closely would the results
          of face enhancement and colour restoration match the original image?
        </p>
        <p>
          For this experiment I used an image of the wife and me that was taken
          a couple of weeks ago. I then desaturated the image and applied a
          2&#8239;px blur to remove enough of the details such that it started
          to look like the old photos in the examples above (actually, I think
          it looks worse).
        </p>
        <p>
          The original image is shown below [<span class="fig-ref"
            >fig.&nbsp;6</span
          >]. The degraded image is shown in
          <span class="fig-ref">fig.&nbsp;7</span>, you can click or tap on
          <span class="fig-ref">fig.&nbsp;7</span> to see the result of the
          restoration.

          There are some pink flowers in the bush that should be green, and the
          face enhancement has decided to shave my beard off, but apart from
          that it's pretty good. Is it as good as the original? of course not.
          The key point here is that it's substantially better than the degraded
          image, and it's close enough to the original that it doesn't look like
          the faces or colour are "made up".

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Some people might look at this type of AI photo restoration as some
          form of “distortion of the truth”, but I'd argue that an old faded
          black & white photograph is not the truth, it's a degraded version of
          the best “truth” that could be captured at the time. Does an AI
          colourised photo represent a perfect reproduction of the true colour?
          no, but guess what—the world was never black & white either.

          I've always felt very disconnected from the people and events shown in
          old black & white photographs—even when they were my own family
          members—I didn’t understand how big the disconnect was until I saw the
          work of Marina Amaral, especially her

          project. Seeing those manually colourised photos made the events and
          people appear more real—which is extremely important given the events
          and people that they record.

          I'm sure that these AI photo restoration tools will soon become part
          of the many online photo libraries (such as Google Photos, Amazon
          Photos, and Microsoft's OneDrive), and I hope they do, as that will
          mean they are available to the general public and hopefully no
          specialised knowledge will be required.
