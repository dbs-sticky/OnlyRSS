        <p>
          I created 'When Bike? - Burghfield' as a tool to help me decide the
          best time to go for a bike ride. It suggests the optimal 1, 2, 3, 4,
          and 5hr slots. I made it public on the off chance that it could be
          useful to other cyclists (or walkers) in the Burghfield area.
