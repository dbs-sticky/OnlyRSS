      <summary><i>Why does this page exist?</i></summary>
      <p>I created 'When Bike? - Burghfield' as a tool to help me decide the best time to go for a bike ride. It suggests the optimal 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5hr slots. I made it public on the off chance that it could be useful to other cyclists (or walkers) in the Burghfield area. <a href="https://onlyrss.org/pages/about.html" target="_blank"> About me</a></p>
