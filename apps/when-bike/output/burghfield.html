      <summary><i>Why does this page exist?</i></summary>
      <p>I created 'When Bike? - Burghfield' as a tool to help me decide the best time to go for a bike ride. It suggests the optimal 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5hr slots. I made it public on the off chance that it could be useful to other cyclists (or walkers) in the Burghfield area. <a href="https://onlyrss.org/pages/about.html" target="_blank"> About me</a></p>

    <div class="ai-output"><p>Here's the bike ride assessment based on the provided weather data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> Monday 21st April 2025</li>
<li><strong>Sunrise:</strong> 5:00</li>
<li><strong>Sunset:</strong> 20:00</li>
<li><strong>Data Updated:</strong> 2025-04-21 07:14:18</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the best time slots for a bike ride, considering UV index, windchill (bike), precipitation probability, wind speed/gusts, and visibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1hr:</strong> 12:00-13:00 - The best single hour slot due to the highest UV index of 5, combined with relatively warmer temperatures and decent visibility, although wind gusts are high and there is some chance of rain.</li>
<li><strong>2hr:</strong> 11:00-13:00 - Good UV index (4 and 5), reasonable temperature, and good visibility although wind is stronger and precipitation probability is higher than earlier hours.</li>
<li><strong>3hr:</strong> 10:00-13:00 - This slot has a good combination of increasing UV index (2, 4, 5), reasonable temperature, but precipitation chance remains significant and wind is a factor.</li>
<li><strong>4hr:</strong> 09:00-13:00 - Expanding the previous slot to include 9:00 allows for more riding time with relatively good weather conditions, though the UV index starts low. Precipitation prob increases as the slot goes on.</li>
<li><strong>5hr:</strong> 09:00-14:00 - Another hour added to the previous slot allows a longer riding time. The average weather conditions are suitable, despite the increasing chance of rain, but wind speeds are also high.</li>
