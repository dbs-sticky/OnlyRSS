      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-06-02">02 Jun 2022</time>: Copied hosting to GitHub Pages</i></span><span
          class="housekeeping-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I read a <a href="https://livecode247.com/deploying-a-static-html-and-css-site-using-github-pages">blog
          post</a> describing how easy it is to host your website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
          Pages</a>, so thought I would try it out to see how it worked. Turned out it worked pretty well (well, after I
        updated a load of paths, turns out I never really understood the differences between, "/", "./" and "../" very
        well).</p>
      <p>I've done a little testing, and it seems that GitHub Pages is consistently faster than my current host. For
        example, the load time for this Changelog page on GitHub is 32&#8239;ms–37&#8239;ms, with my current host it's
        55&#8239;ms–74&#8239;ms.</p>
      <p> Other differences I've noticed between GitHub Pages compared to my current host; they have a fixed cache
        max-age = 10&#8239;mins, and don't yet support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli">Brotli
          compression</a>. Also, GitHub Pages is free! I do host a couple of small websites alongside OnlyRSS, so it's
        not as simple as me moving to GitHub Pages and not having to pay for my current hosting, but I do suspect that
        GitHub Pages will become the primary host for OnlyRSS, all that remains is for me to point the domain to it.

      <p>Here's a link to the <a href="https://dbs-sticky.github.io/OnlyRSS/">GitHub Pages hosted version</a>.

            with CSS Counters</i></span><span class="content-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Five days ago I implemented the auto-labelling and numbering for all figures across OnlyRSS.org. This article
        describes how I did it using just CSS & HTML.

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-05-28">28 May 2022</time>: Fixed link styles in fig captions and lists using
          the <i>::where</i> selector</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I use a specific style for links used in article bodies, i.e. links are followed by a "°" symbol, which is
        either red (external links) or blue (internal links). This was working fine in paragraphs, but not in lists or
        fig captions. This was because I was simply using:</p>
      <pre><code>p a {[style]}</code></pre>
      <p>I wanted to apply the same style to lists and fig captions, but rather than repeating the same CSS for all
        three, I used—for the fist time—the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where"><i>::where</i> CSS Selector</a>. So I now have:
      </p>
      <pre><code>::where(p, li, figcaption) a {[style]}</code></pre>
      <p>I suspect I'll be using this selector a lot going forward. </p>

          class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I added the PWA shortcuts (aka jump list) a few days ago, but didn't give each shortcut their own icon. Adding
        individual icons makes the PWA appear a little more "native", and less like a web page in disguise! I'm not very
        happy with the current icons I've created, so will probably update them soon.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-05-23">23 May 2022</time>: Implemented auto label and numbering for all figure
          captions i.e. Figure 1, 2, 3,…etc.</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I read a very useful article over at smashingmagazine.com today titled <a
          href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/lesser-known-underused-css-features-2022/">“Lesser-Known And
          Underused CSS Features In 2022”</a>, it contained a <a
          href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/lesser-known-underused-css-features-2022/#counters">section on
          CSS Counters</a>. I learnt that Counters can keep track of the number of specific HTML tags e.g.
        &lt;figcaption&gt;, and then display the current count in the page. I used this to automatically add “Figure #”
        before each figure caption. This is useful for those times when I decide to slot a new figure into a page, as I
        wouldn't then need to renumber all the following figures.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-05-23">23 May 2022</time>: Fixed the global navigation bar to the top of the
          page</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>The introduction of the global navigation bar back in April greatly improved the site navigation, but, users
        still had to scroll to the top of a page in order to navigate to a new page. Fixing the nav bar to the top of
        the viewport has removed this pain point (at the expense of a small amount of screen real estate).</p>

          shortcuts)</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Updated the app description, and added app screenshots to the manifest.json. When a visitor to OnlyRSS.org is
        prompted to install the app on Android, they now have the option to view some in-app screenshots prior to
        performing the install.</p>
      <p> After install, if they long-press on the app icon on Android, or right-click on the app icon on the Windows
        taskbar, they will now see shortcuts for Articles, RSS, Changelog, and About pages.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-04-13">13 Apr 2022</time>: Added Alt text to images—even though they already
          use &lt;figcaption&gt;</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Strictly speaking, Alt text for images is not required if you're using the &lt;figcaption&gt; element, as this
        element will contain a description of the image which will be read out by screen readers. And as all my images
        have a &lt;figcaption&gt;, I'd not been using Alt text. But, after giving this some thought I'd come to the
        conclusion that Alt text is required in most cases even when &lt;figcaption&gt; is used.</p>
      <p>A typical figure caption for a chart might be 'Figure 1. Chart showing the change in price of oil over time'.
        But, it's not a complete description of what's happening on the chart, it doesn't need to be, that's the purpose
        of the chart! The Alt text I've added for my images tries to describe the content of the image in words, rather
        than a simple statement about what the image is.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-04-13">13 Apr 2022</time>: Made all fonts local, and set some fonts to
          <i>font-display: block</i></span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p><abbr title="Flash of Unstyled Text">FOUT</abbr> can be an issue for many websites, but it wasn't a particular
        problem on OnlyRSS until I added the global nav bar. The size of the 'buttons' on the nav bar are determined by
        the size of the button names e.g. RSS, About, and Changelog. When the page is first loaded these button names
        are displayed using the fallback font (while the primary font is loaded), this resulted in a noticeable movement
        of the nav bar buttons that was very distracting.</p>
      <img src="../images/nav-issue.gif" loading="lazy"
        alt="An animated GIF showing a user selecting nav elements and the elements shifting position as they reload"
        width="368" height="68">
      <p>This was solved by switching the font used on the nav bar from <i>font-display: swap</i> to <i>font-display:
          block</i>. The result is that the nav bar font is essentially invisible until the primary font has loaded,
        this seems to have fixed the issue.</p>
      <p>Before I discovered the solution above, I'd also downloaded all the fonts from Google and hosted them locally,
        although this didn't fix the issue, there are other reasons to do this, but I think that will be the subject of
        a future article.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-04-10">10 Apr 2022</time>: Added the global navigation bar</span><span
          class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>As the site has grown to include a few pages i.e. RSS, Changelog, About (separate to the articles), the
        navigation required a bit of an upgrade from the single home-button. This first version is a simple top nav bar,
        with the home button on the left, and buttons for the dedicated pages on the right. They are separated by a
        single empty span element that has its flex set to 1, this pushes the various buttons to the far-left and
        -right.</p>

          &lt;summary&gt; HTML elements</span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>The &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; HTML elements are what's used to create these Changelog entries, but,
        I've also started to use them in articles to hide images until requested by the reader.</p>
      <p> On article pages, I used the pseudo-element <i>::after</i> to append the content "close" or "open" to the
        &lt;summary&gt; text. I used <i>details[open] summary::after{ }</i> to target the summary element only when the
        detail element was open, the result was an open/close toggle built with just HTML & CSS.</p>

      <p>This article describes how I used the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; HTML elements in combination with the
        lazyloading image attribute to hide and delay the loading of images until they are requested by users. I did
        this to make the default load state of the page shorter and more concise, and to improve page load performance.

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-04-03">03 Apr 2022</time>: Created the <i>Subscribe to OnlyRSS</i>
          page</span><span class="content-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>The RSS link on the homepage used to open the RSS feed, for users unfamiliar with RSS this might have been
        confusing. The link now opens a 'subscribe' page which includes the RSS feed URL and instructions on how to
        subscribe via Feedly and Inoreader.</p>
      <p>I created 2 animated GIFs (each ≈300kB) showing the subscription process in Feedly and Inoreader, but I didn't
        want these to have a negative effect on the page load performance (the GIFs are not essential for the page), so
        I hid them in the &lt;detail&gt; element and set the image attribute 'loading="lazy"' (usually used to delay the
        loading of images that are below the fold), to my surprise this worked, and the images only load when the user
        interacts with the &lt;detail&gt; element.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-24">24 Mar 2022</time>: Changed the link style for text</span><span
          class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This is a bit controversial. Hyperlinks are meant to be blue and underlined. Many websites obviously don't
        follow this guideline, and instead use a colour, or an underline, but they're typically using one or the other.
        If an article contains many links, I find the existing options a bit distracting (see any page on Wikipedia as
        an example), especially if I'm not actually going to click on any of the links. So, I've adopted the <a
          href="https://practicaltypography.com/how-to-use.html#">link style</a> used by Matthew Butterick in his online
        book <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/"><i>Butterick's Practical Typography</i></a> (he uses it for
        external links only, I'm using it for internal and external links.) I've used a red circle for external links,
        and blue for internal. On-hover, the linked text will also change to the appropriate colour.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-20">20 Mar 2022</time>: Should your &lt;header&gt; be in your
          &lt;article&gt;, or above your &lt;article&gt;?</span><span class="housekeeping-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This isn't a rhetorical question. There doesn't appear to be an agreed answer online for this. Today I moved
        all the article &lt;header&gt; elements and placed them within the &lt;article&gt; elements. Previously they had
        been above.</p>
      <p> The <i>HTML Article</i> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or
        site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable e.g., a forum post, a magazine or
        newspaper article
      <p>
      <p>The <i>HTML Header</i> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or
        navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and
        other elements.</p>
      <p>I've decided that if the Header is meant to contain introductory content, and often the h1, then it's essential
        for the article to which it belongs, and as the &lt;article&gt; content is meant to be self-contained (i.e.
        suitable for redistribution) then (at least for my use case) the &lt;header&gt; should be in the
        &lt;article&gt;.</p>
      <p>Previously the page outline (the visual outline I mean i.e. the border and drop-shadow) was represented by a
        &lt;main&gt; with a specific CSS Class applied. This has now been replaced by &lt;article&gt;, i.e. I've got rid
        of another CSS Class and replaced it with a semantic HTML element, which is a positive as far as I'm concerned.

          &lt;aside&gt; element</span><span class="housekeeping-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I've tried my best to avoid non-semantic HTML elements where possible i.e. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;. The
        homepage uses a few &lt;div&gt; elements (to create the cards), and this page uses &lt;span&gt; (for the tags),
        apart from that the whole site uses <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp"
          title="Read about semantic HTML elements at W3C schools">semantic HTML tags</a>. I've avoided the use of CSS
        IDs altogether, and have only defined a few CSS Classes.</p>
      <p>I was using a few &lt;div&gt; elements for the related articles that appear at the bottom of a couple of
        articles, but there is a specific HTML element designed to show related content i.e. the &lt;aside&gt; element.
        Here's the description of the aside element from W3C Schools, <q>The aside element represents a section of a
          page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element.</q></p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-19">19 Mar 2022</time>: Added SVG social icons to the About page
        </span><span class="ux-tag"><span class="performance-tag"></span></span></summary>
      <p>This was a bit of a rabbit-hole for me. I downloaded a few social media icons from the web in <abbr
          title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr> format, and created some of my own in Figma. I then had to work out
        the correct Viewbox size etc. I wanted the icons to appear outlined with a white fill, but then have the fill
        fade to their brand colours on-hover. This took a bit of CSS work to get right. Basically, the SVG is inline
        with the HTML and includes the fill colour. The CSS then overrides this and sets the fill to transparent.
        On-hover the transparency is then removed (via a 0.9s transition) to reveal the fill colour. Doing it this way
        means that the CSS is generic and works for all the icons—it removes the need for a CSS Class or ID per icon.
      </p>
      <p> The SVG icons and the required CSS take up 12kB of space, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli"
          title="read about Brotli text compression">when compressed for transfer to the browser</a> comes to around
        2kB. Not bad (<abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>) for 8 coloured icons that can be scaled to any
        size. If these 8 icons were PNGs or GIFs they would each have to be loaded after the HTML and CSS. The inline
        SVG solution means they are loaded with/in the HTML.</p>
      <p> In case it's not obvious from the description above…yes, I am quite proud of myself. &#128512;</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-16">16 Mar 2022</time>: Right-aligned the tags in the Changelog
        </span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This actually took me a little while to figure out. Had to wrap the date/description in a &lt;span&gt;, (the
        tags already use &lt;span&gt;) then I set the first span in the Changelog summary to flex:1, I did this using
        the first-of-type CSS selector i.e. 'summary span:first-of-type {flex: 1}'. The other &lt;spans&gt; (used by the
        tags) would default to flex:0. The result of which is that the date/description expands to fill the row and
        pushes the tags to the far right.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-14">14 Mar 2022</time>: Moved the links to the Latin fonts into the HTML
          head </span><span class="performance-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Previously, I'd moved the Google font code i.e. @import (which itself linked to a stylesheet) from the CSS and
        into the head of the HTML, therefore removing a “chain” when loading the page. This time I moved the links to
        the Latin version of the fonts directly into the HTML head. It removes another “chain”, and page load speed for
        most pages is now around 30-50&#8239;ms. Without actually minifying the CSS and moving it into the HTML head,
        there's not much else I can do now to improve page performance. </p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-13">13 Mar 2022</time>: Created this <i>Changelog</i> page </span><span
          class="content-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>One of the reasons for creating this website is to learn HTML and CSS, so I thought it might make sense to list
        the changes and explain what I've learnt along the way. This changelog makes use of the &lt;details&gt; and
        &lt;summary&gt; HTML tags (combined with a little CSS, you end up with these little 'expandable' sections, no JS
        required.)</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-12">12 Mar 2022</time>: Replaced the <i>About</i> page </span><span
          class="content-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>The original <i>About</i> page used a 2-column layout that didn't work well on mobile, for the sake of
        simplicity I decided to use the standard article page style/CSS.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-12">12 Mar 2022</time>: Switched GitHub repository from Private to Public,
          added link to nav</span><span class="housekeeping-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>I don't think anyone is going to be cloning my repository anytime soon, but having it public just makes things
        a little simpler, and allows me to see better analytics related to my own commits.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-11">11 Mar 2022</time>: Moved font import from CSS to the &lt;head&gt; of
          each page </span><span class="performance-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This took a bit of research. When looking at the load order of page elements, I noticed that most of the page
        was waiting for the fonts to load, and this was not starting until <em>after</em> the CSS had loaded. By moving
        the font import into the HTML, the font load can start in parallel with the CSS, resulting in a faster page
        load.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-11">11 Mar 2022</time>: Improved the PWA user experience </span><span
          class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Created new PWA icons, added the required apple-touch-icons, added a maskable icon, changed the display type in
        the manifest from <i>minimal-ui</i> to <i>standalone</i>, and added a theme-color in the HTML &lt;head&gt;.</p>
      <p>These changes greatly improve the PWA user experience, especially on iOS devices. OnlyRSS.org now gets a 100%
        PWA score via the open-source Lighthouse tool.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-10">10 Mar 2022</time>: Removed Google Analytics </span><span
          class="performance-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>OK, this one needs some explaining, especially as one of my stated aims for building OnlyRSS is as a learning
        experience.</p>
      <p>Analytics are great for measuring success (especially if success is defined by the number of page views), or
        for trying to write “better” content (by measuring the popularity of existing content, and creating more of the
        same). But, my aim is not to write articles that will result in a large number of page views, or to create a
        blog that will become popular. My sole aim is to learn HTML and CSS, and maybe create articles that at least one
        other person on the internet will find useful. The analytics were interesting, but they weren't free, and the
        cost was actually quite high, and it was not being paid by me, it was being paid by the site's visitors. The
        cost was a reduction in user experience.</p>
      <p> Basically, the page load times were dominated by the JS required for the analytics. Removing the analytics
        resulted in far better performance, i.e. much faster load times. So I made the decision to remove the analytics
        and give visitors a better experience.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-10">10 Mar 2022</time>: Added loading="lazy" to images </span><span
          class="performance-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This required some research, mostly to determine which images would benefit and which would not. Essentially
        this image attribute won't load an image until the browser thinks that the user is actually going to view it,
        i.e. it looks at a user's scrolling behaviour, and loads the image just before the user gets to the specific
        section of the page. Although all images on my site are optimised to be as small as possible, there's still no
        need to load an image at the bottom of the page if the user is never going to see it.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-09">09 Mar 2022</time>: Added OpenGraph meta tags to most pages
        </span><span class="seo-tag"></span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This required a lot of research and some testing to get it right (tip: .webp images are NOT supported!), enough
        that I'll probably create a post about this topic. Basically, if I add an article link to Twitter, LinkedIn or
        Facebook, they will contain a specific title, description and image and will typically be displayed in some form
        of card design.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-08">08 Mar 2022</time>: My first use of the &lt;abbr&gt; HTML tag
        </span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>There are many HTML tags that are underused (IMHO), and &lt;abbr&gt; is probably one of them. It allows you to
        show the full text on hover for an abbreviation, e.g., <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>.</p>
      <p> I made a few tweaks to the CSS, so on hover the cursor changes to the help-pointer, and on mobile you can tap
        the abbreviation, and it is then shown in-line in full after the abbreviation.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-03-05">05 Mar 2022</time>: Added 'related articles' to the bottom of some

      <p>My articles cover various subjects, some of which could be placed into groups, so I defined a style (not
        finished) for the display of 'related articles' which will appear at the end of some articles.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-02-28">28 Feb 2022</time>: Added &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; to
          articles and changed accent colour </span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Placed all article images into the HTML figure tag. Removed the 'alt' attribute from images, as this was no
        longer required—assuming the &lt;figcaption&gt; includes a full description of the image.</p>
      <p>Also changed the accent colour of the site from red to blue, because everybody knows that blue is the best
        colour.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-02-27">27 Feb 2022</time>: Converted the majority of images to the .webp

      <p>Did some research regarding browser support and the modern image format of .webp. Decided to replace all images
        that would benefit from it to the new format in order to improve page load performance.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-02-26">26 Feb 2022</time>: Made the site responsive—finally looks good on
          mobile </span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>Prior to this the mobile version of the site was terrible, it so bad that mobile browsers kept requesting users
        to use their 'reader' view. This required me to learn how to use Media Queries and to add the viewport tag into
        the HTML head.</p>

      <summary><span><time datetime="2022-02-21">21 Feb 2022</time>: Project Unity. One style to rule them all
        </span><span class="ux-tag"></span></summary>
      <p>This was a big change for the site, removing all individual styles (one per article) and settling on a single
        style. Prior to this each article had its own style—this was on purpose, as it gave me the reason I needed to
        practice CSS. It also allowed me to put into practice what I learnt from reading 3 typography books over the
        previous couple of weeks.</p>

      <p>A PWA version of OnlyRSS.org is not really needed by anyone. This was more a case of "can it be done?". I'm
        also considering turning one of my web products into a PWA for my users, so this was an interesting learning
        experience for me.</p>

      <p>Not a big need for this change, other than the fact that I wanted to see how easy it would be to makes "cards"
