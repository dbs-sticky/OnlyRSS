        </summary>
        <p>
          As a Product Manager and a fan of RSS, it was only a matter of time until I wrote about the benefits of RSS for Product Managers. This article is a classic listicle, big on numbers (in the range 1–10), short on details.
        </p>
        <p>
           I suspect I'll create a follow-up article that goes into detail on how to achieve some of the benefits e.g. how to monitor the web for product/brand mentions using Feedly, Inoreader, or Google Alerts etc.

          This is an updated version of the infographic that I wrote <a href="../posts/top-25-pax-airlines.html" title="view the original article">about a few weeks ago</a>. This version is standalone and has been optimised to make better use of large displays.

          This infographic (the whole webpage) is very lean, requiring just <mark>31&#8239;kB</mark> to be transferred to the browser. The only resources loaded by the browser are the HTML file, and 2 fonts (both of which have been subset, with one containing just a single glyph). All the airline tailfin SVGs are inline in the HTML, and the stylesheet has been minified and included in the head of the HTML.

          I wanted to highlight some data values within a paragraph, and a highlighter-pen effect seemed like a good idea. I like the idea of visually highlighting values within an article, especially when they are key to the story.

          The first image below shows the original table design used in my <a href="../posts/learning-log-2022.html">Learning Log 2022</a> article. The bars/lines at the bottom of each row are meant to indicate the progress against the task, but it's far too subtle. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The new design (second image below) adds a 3rd column which includes a more traditional progress indicator. The value that indicates the progress is defined as an attribute in the HTML, I'll probably write an article about how this was built at a later date.

          I spent longer on this article than any other, specifically the infographic. I'd pretty much completed the infographic using inline-SVGs and then realised it would have been better using a Unicode glyph, so I started again.

          I thought that creating charts with just HTML & CSS was going to be much harder than it actually was, and although it took me a while to build the 2 charts in the article, I'm confident that when I build my next data visualisation I'll be much quicker.

          This was also my first real opportunity to make extensive use CSS of Flexbox.

        </summary>
        <p>
          In order to reduce the load time of the homepage on mobile devices, and to reduce the amount of scrolling that's required to view the list of articles, I've removed the images from the cards on the homepage. To do this I used <i>display: none;</i> so that the images are hidden, and I combined this with <i>loading="lazy"</i>, to ensure that the images are not loaded by the browser.

        </summary>
        <p>
          When I first added an avatar to the article bylines (just 2 days ago) I opted to hide the avatar on mobile displays as there simply wasn't enough width on the byline row to show the avatar, copy, and sharing icons.
        </p>
        <p> I then decided that this was lazy, so I came up with a solution that simply switches the byline from a CSS flex row (on wide displays), to a CSS flex column (on narrow displays). This (along with a couple of other small tweaks) gives the result shown below on mobile displays:

        <p>
          The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lensa.app" target="_blank" title="The Lensa app on Google Play">Lensa</a> AI avatar app is <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-11-15%202022-12-10&q=lensa" target="_blank" title="View results for Lense on Google Trends">all the rage at the moment</a>, so of course I had to give it a go. And much to my surprise, amoung the 50 images it created were some really good ones, one of which I've chosen as my new avatar for all my various networks/apps.
        </p>
        <p> I also decided to add it to the byline on all my articles, it's a little vain (and pointless, as I'm the only author), but it does break up the pages a little (which are often just text). It's a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" target="_blank" title="View a description of the webp image format.">.webp</a>, and has been compressed to within an inch of its life, so comes in at 3&#8239;KB, not bad for a 200x200&#8239;px image.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not shown on mobile devices when in portrait mode, I did this as the byline row was wider than the viewport, so the easiest solution was to simply drop the avatar.

          <span><time datetime="2022-12-07">07 Dec 2022</time>: Updated the sharing icons to inline SVGs </span><ux-tag></ux-tag>
        </summary>
        <p>
          My previous Changelog update was about moving the article sharing options from the bottom of article pages to the top, and changing them from text to SVG icons. Initially the SVGs were linked to the page via IMG tags, but I decided to use inline SVGs so I could better target their attributes (fill etc.) via CSS. I also changed the email icon so it better matches the style of the Twitter and LinkedIn icons. Each uses a cut-out, so the shadow can be seen through the icon on hover. This can be seen in the GIF below:

        <summary >
          <span><time datetime="2022-11-20">20 Nov 2022</time>: Replaced article sharing links with SVG icons, and moved to the top of articles </span><ux-tag></ux-tag>
        </summary>
        <p>
          A colleague suggested that I move my article sharing links from the bottom of the page to the top. In a perfect world people would read an article before deciding to share it, but we don't live in a perfect world (Trump, Putin, Brexit, the US date format), so I decided to implement his suggestion. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also took the opportunity to replace the old text links with SVG icons (total file size of icons = 996&#8239;Bytes).
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally I'd "inline" my SVGs in the HTML, but as these sharing icons are used on every article page I decided to link out to them via <i>&#60;img src="…"</i>, this has a downside I was not aware of. With inline elements you can use CSS to directly affect the SVG's paths, e.g. fill, stroke, opacity etc. When linking out to the SVG files you cannot do this. To achieve the “fade to colour” effect shown below I had to resort to the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter" title="The MDN page explaining what CSS Filters are"> CSS Filters</a>.

        </summary>
        <p>
          The cards used on the homepage were created before I really knew how to use CSS Flex properly, and they were far from ideal—changing the format of the text on the cards used to break the layout. I rebuilt them from the ground up using CSS Flex. Now the design is far better and won't break due to the cards' contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also changed the date format and added a “misc” tag to all cards that didn't fit nicely into any of the existing categories.

          They have some simple sharing links on the bottom of all article pages on the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-writing-study-guide/">Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) website</a>. I thought it would be a good feature for OnlyRSS.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've pretty much copied their solution, but along the way I learnt how the sharing URL has to be structured such that after being clicked, the user is taken to the social network (Twitter or LinkedIn) and the article title and link are available and ready to be easily shared.

          If you combine this with OpenGraph metadata in each article, it makes for a very effective sharing experience, as you can see in the Twitter example below.

          I've been working my way through all the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-writing-study-guide/">UX articles related to unstructured content</a>.

          The aim of an article is not to be read, the aim is the transfer of knowledge, and if that can be achieved with a simple summary, then that's good with me—I'm not going to fill a page with fluff and keep the reader guessing so they have to scroll past a hundred ads before they find what they are looking for!

          I recently completed the new

          including the one on GitHub Actions. I had already been using Actions
          to deploy all code to my host (via FTP) after a Push to Master, but I
          wanted to see if I could add some automated testing as part of the
          same process.

          in the Actions marketplace. In order to implement it in series with
          the existing FTP deployment action, I had to get to grips with Actions
          (i.e.

          describing how easy it is to host your website on
          <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, so thought I
          would try it out to see how it worked. Turned out it worked pretty
          well (well, after I updated a load of paths, turns out I never really
          understood the differences between, "/", "./" and "../" very well).
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve done a little testing, and it seems that GitHub Pages is
          consistently faster than my current host. For example, the load time
          for this Changelog page on GitHub is 32&#8239;ms–37&#8239;ms, with my
          current host it’s 55&#8239;ms–74&#8239;ms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other differences I’ve noticed between GitHub Pages compared to my
          current host; they have a fixed cache max-age = 10&#8239;mins, and
          don’t yet support
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli">Brotli compression</a>.
          Also, GitHub Pages is free! I do host a couple of small websites
          alongside OnlyRSS, so it’s not as simple as me moving to GitHub Pages
          and not having to pay for my current hosting, but I do suspect that
          GitHub Pages will become the primary host for OnlyRSS, all that
          remains is for me to point the domain to it.

        <p>
          I use a specific style for links used in article bodies, i.e. links
          are followed by a "°" symbol, which is either red (external links) or
          blue (internal links). This was working fine in paragraphs, but not in
          lists or fig captions. This was because I was simply using:
        </p>
        <pre><code>p a {[style]}</code></pre>
        <p>
          I wanted to apply the same style to lists and fig captions, but rather
          than repeating the same CSS for all three, I used—for the fist
          time—the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where"
            ><strong>::where</strong> CSS Selector</a

        </p>
        <pre><code>::where(p, li, figcaption) a {[style]}</code></pre>
        <p>I suspect I’ll be using this selector a lot going forward.</p>

          in the page. I used this to automatically add “Figure #” before each
          figure caption. This is useful for those times when I decide to slot a
          new figure into a page, as I wouldn’t then need to renumber all the
          following figures.

        </summary>
        <p>
          Strictly speaking, Alt text for images is not required if you’re using
          the &lt;figcaption&gt; element, as this element will contain a
          description of the image which will be read out by screen readers. And
          as all my images have a &lt;figcaption&gt;, I’d not been using Alt
          text. But, after giving this some thought I’d come to the conclusion
          that Alt text is required in most cases even when &lt;figcaption&gt;
          is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical figure caption for a chart might be ‘Figure 1. Chart showing
          the change in price of oil over time’. But, it’s not a complete
          description of what’s happening on the chart, it doesn’t need to be,
          that’s the purpose of the chart! The Alt text I’ve added for my images
          tries to describe the content of the image in words, rather than a
          simple statement about what the image is.

          added the global nav bar. The size of the ‘buttons’ on the nav bar are
          determined by the size of the button names e.g. RSS, About, and
          Changelog. When the page is first loaded these button names are
          displayed using the fallback font (while the primary font is loaded),
          this resulted in a noticeable movement of the nav bar buttons that was
          very distracting.

        <p>
          This was solved by switching the font used on the nav bar from
          <strong>font-display: swap</strong> to <strong>font-display: block</strong>. The result is
          that the nav bar font is essentially invisible until the primary font
          has loaded, this seems to have fixed the issue.

        <p>
          Before I discovered the solution above, I’d also downloaded all the
          fonts from Google and hosted them locally, although this didn’t fix
          the issue, there are other reasons to do this, but I think that will
          be the subject of a future article.

          As the site has grown to include a few pages i.e. RSS, Changelog,

          upgrade from the single home-button. This first version is a simple
          top nav bar, with the home button on the left, and buttons for the
          dedicated pages on the right. They are separated by a single empty
          span element that has its flex set to 1, this pushes the various
          buttons to the far-left and -right.

          The &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; HTML elements are what’s used
          to create these Changelog entries, but, I’ve also started to use them
          in articles to hide images until requested by the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          On article pages, I used the pseudo-element <strong>::after</strong> to append
          the content "close" or "open" to the &lt;summary&gt; text. I used
          <strong>details[open] summary::after{ }</strong> to target the summary element
          only when the detail element was open, the result was an open/close
          toggle built with just HTML & CSS.

          This article describes how I used the &lt;details&gt; and
          &lt;summary&gt; HTML elements in combination with the lazyloading
          image attribute to hide and delay the loading of images until they are
          requested by users. I did this to make the default load state of the
          page shorter and more concise, and to improve page load performance.

        <p>
          The RSS link on the homepage used to open the RSS feed, for users
          unfamiliar with RSS this might have been confusing. The link now opens
          a ‘subscribe’ page which includes the RSS feed URL and instructions on
          how to subscribe via Feedly and Inoreader.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created 2 animated GIFs (each ≈300kB) showing the subscription
          process in Feedly and Inoreader, but I didn’t want these to have a
          negative effect on the page load performance (the GIFs are not
          essential for the page), so I hid them in the &lt;detail&gt; element
          and set the image attribute ‘loading="lazy"’ (usually used to delay
          the loading of images that are below the fold), to my surprise this
          worked, and the images only load when the user interacts with the
          &lt;detail&gt; element.

          This is a bit controversial. Hyperlinks are meant to be blue and
          underlined. Many websites obviously don’t follow this guideline, and
          instead use a colour, or an underline, but they’re typically using one
          or the other. If an article contains many links, I find the existing
          options a bit distracting (see any page on Wikipedia as an example),
          especially if I’m not actually going to click on any of the links. So,
          I’ve adopted the
          <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/how-to-use.html#"
            >link style</a

          >
          (he uses it for external links only, I’m using it for internal and
          external links.) I’ve used a red circle for external links, and blue
          for internal. On-hover, the linked text will also change to the
          appropriate colour.

        </summary>
        <p>
          This isn’t a rhetorical question. There doesn’t appear to be an agreed
          answer online for this. Today I moved all the article &lt;header&gt;
          elements and placed them within the &lt;article&gt; elements.
          Previously they had been above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>HTML Article</strong> element represents a self-contained
          composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is
          intended to be independently distributable or reusable e.g., a forum
          post, a magazine or newspaper article
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>HTML Header</strong> element represents introductory content,
          typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain
          some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name,
          and other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve decided that if the Header is meant to contain introductory
          content, and often the h1, then it’s essential for the article to
          which it belongs, and as the &lt;article&gt; content is meant to be
          self-contained (i.e. suitable for redistribution) then (at least for
          my use case) the &lt;header&gt; should be in the &lt;article&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously the page outline (the visual outline I mean i.e. the border
          and drop-shadow) was represented by a &lt;main&gt; with a specific CSS
          Class applied. This has now been replaced by &lt;article&gt;, i.e.
          I’ve got rid of another CSS Class and replaced it with a semantic HTML
          element, which is a positive as far as I’m concerned.

        <p>
          I’ve tried my best to avoid non-semantic HTML elements where possible
          i.e. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;. The homepage uses a few &lt;div&gt;
          elements (to create the cards), and this page uses &lt;span&gt; (for
          the tags), apart from that the whole site uses
          <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp"
            title="Read about semantic HTML elements at W3C schools"
            >semantic HTML tags</a
          >. I’ve avoided the use of CSS IDs altogether, and have only defined a
          few CSS Classes.

        <p>
          I was using a few &lt;div&gt; elements for the related articles that
          appear at the bottom of a couple of articles, but there is a specific
          HTML element designed to show related content i.e. the &lt;aside&gt;
          element. Here’s the description of the aside element from W3C Schools,
          <q
            >The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of
            content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside

            icons to the About page </span
          ><span class="ux-tag"><performance-tag></performance-tag></span>
        </summary>
        <p>
          This was a bit of a rabbit-hole for me. I downloaded a few social
          media icons from the web in
          <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr> format, and created
          some of my own in Figma. I then had to work out the correct Viewbox
          size etc. I wanted the icons to appear outlined with a white fill, but
          then have the fill fade to their brand colours on-hover. This took a
          bit of CSS work to get right. Basically, the SVG is inline with the
          HTML and includes the fill colour. The CSS then overrides this and
          sets the fill to transparent. On-hover the transparency is then
          removed (via a 0.9s transition) to reveal the fill colour. Doing it
          this way means that the CSS is generic and works for all the icons—it
          removes the need for a CSS Class or ID per icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SVG icons and the required CSS take up 12kB of space, which
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli"
            title="read about Brotli text compression"
            >when compressed for transfer to the browser</a
          >
          comes to around 2kB. Not bad (<abbr title="In My Humble Opinion"
            >IMHO</abbr
          >) for 8 coloured icons that can be scaled to any size. If these 8
          icons were PNGs or GIFs they would each have to be loaded after the
          HTML and CSS. The inline SVG solution means they are loaded with/in
          the HTML.

          This actually took me a little while to figure out. Had to wrap the
          date/description in a &lt;span&gt;, (the tags already use
          &lt;span&gt;) then I set the first span in the Changelog summary to
          flex:1, I did this using the first-of-type CSS selector i.e. ‘summary
          span:first-of-type {flex: 1}’. The other &lt;spans&gt; (used by the
          tags) would default to flex:0. The result of which is that the
          date/description expands to fill the row and pushes the tags to the
          far right.

        <p>
          Previously, I’d moved the Google font code i.e. @import (which itself
          linked to a stylesheet) from the CSS and into the head of the HTML,
          therefore removing a “chain” when loading the page. This time I moved
          the links to the Latin version of the fonts directly into the HTML
          head. It removes another “chain”, and page load speed for most pages
          is now around 30-50&#8239;ms. Without actually minifying the CSS and
          moving it into the HTML head, there’s not much else I can do now to
          improve page performance.

          The original <strong>About</strong> page used a 2-column layout that didn’t work

          I don’t think anyone is going to be cloning my repository anytime

        <p>
          This took a bit of research. When looking at the load order of page
          elements, I noticed that most of the page was waiting for the fonts to
          load, and this was not starting until <em>after</em> the CSS had
          loaded. By moving the font import into the HTML, the font load can
          start in parallel with the CSS, resulting in a faster page load.

          OK, this one needs some explaining, especially as one of my stated

          Analytics are great for measuring success (especially if success is
          defined by the number of page views), or for trying to write “better”
          content (by measuring the popularity of existing content, and creating
          more of the same). But, my aim is not to write articles that will
          result in a large number of page views, or to create a blog that will
          become popular. My sole aim is to learn HTML and CSS, and maybe create
          articles that at least one other person on the internet will find
          useful. The analytics were interesting, but they weren’t free, and the
          cost was actually quite high, and it was not being paid by me, it was
          being paid by the site’s visitors. The cost was a reduction in user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, the page load times were dominated by the JS required for
          the analytics. Removing the analytics resulted in far better
          performance, i.e. much faster load times. So I made the decision to
          remove the analytics and give visitors a better experience.

          This required some research, mostly to determine which images would
          benefit and which would not. Essentially this image attribute won’t
          load an image until the browser thinks that the user is actually going
          to view it, i.e. it looks at a user’s scrolling behaviour, and loads
          the image just before the user gets to the specific section of the
          page. Although all images on my site are optimised to be as small as
          possible, there’s still no need to load an image at the bottom of the
          page if the user is never going to see it.

          There are many HTML tags that are underused (IMHO), and &lt;abbr&gt;

          help-pointer, and on mobile you can tap the abbreviation, and it is
          then shown in-line in full after the abbreviation.

          While building Cirium Profiles, we came up with a neat solution to
          help mitigate one of the issues with stacked bar charts. This article
          describes what we did, and why.

          My articles cover various subjects, some of which could be placed into

          Also changed the accent colour of the site from red to blue, because

          Prior to this the mobile version of the site was terrible, it so bad

          This was a big change for the site, removing all individual styles

          article had its own style—this was on purpose, as it gave me the
          reason I needed to practice CSS. It also allowed me to put into
          practice what I learnt from reading 3 typography books over the
          previous couple of weeks.
