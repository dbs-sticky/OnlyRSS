# OnlyRSS

This is my personal blog which I created so that I can learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's all hand built, no CMS etc. I started the blog initially with no website, the articles existed only in the RSS feed (hence the domain name), this changed quite quickly and OnlyRSS became a real blog with real pages.
