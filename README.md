# OnlyRSS
OnlyRSS started out as an RSS feed—with no associated website (hence the domain name). The articles only existed in the feed, and they could only be accessed via RSS readers such as Feedly and Inoreader.

As I became increasingly interested in typography and article design I decided to be a little more traditional and actually make my articles visible on a website. At that point, OnlyRSS became my “learning tool” i.e. it became my excuse to learn the fundamentals of HTML & CSS…and maybe some JavaScript.

OnlyRSS is all hand-made, there's no CMS, no frameworks, no static site generator etc. even the RSS feed is updated by hand when new articles are published. It's been built to be as lean and fast as possible—and that also means no analytics. The success of OnlyRSS is measured by an increase in my knowledge of HTML & CSS, not by the number of pageviews.
