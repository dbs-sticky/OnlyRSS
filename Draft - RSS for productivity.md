# RSS for productivity
## What is RSS?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many (potentially, hundreds) different websites in a single news aggregator. Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, or episodes of audio and video series. RSS is also used to distribute podcasts. An RSS document (usually called the "feed") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name.

## So what exactly is a News aggregator?
A News aggregator is simply a software application, it can be desktop, but these days it's typically online. Feedly and Inoreader are two popular online versions and both have the similar capabilities i.e. they allow you to search for, and then subscribe to, many different websites (mostly blogs and news sites, but also search results). Whenever new content is published, rather than visit 100 different websites, you simply open your News aggregator, and see the full list of content in a nice, easy to digest list. You can then mark as read, save for later, share, add notes to etc.

## What should I care?
Let start with the basics, the Cambridge dictionary defines data as:

> Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making

Notice that the definition says nothing about the way the information is structured. Data is just as likely to be unstructured (e.g. Social media posts, videos, images, charts, news articles, blog posts etc.) as it is to be structured (tables, spreadsheets etc.). In fact, more than **80 percent** of all data generated today is considered unstructured.

If you ask people within  any type of organisation how they analyse their data, you'll probably get an answer pretty quick, and that answer is likely to be Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI etc. But, ask them how they analyse the news, and you'll probably get a confused look. Most companies have a process in place for the aggregation, analysis, and dissemination of their structured content (typically some form of data lake, analytics tool, and shared dashboards), but how many have solutions for the aggregation, analysis and sharing of news?
