# Welcome!

If you are seeing this then you have clicked on an article title from the OnlyRSS feed. Normally those links would take you to the website that hosts and displays the article, **but OnlyRSS has no such website, the articles only exist in the RSS feed**, and can only be viewed in RSS Aggregators such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com) and [Inoreader](http://inoreader.com). 

If you have any questions about OnlyRSS, then please ask me (Mark Evans) via [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/dbs_sticky)
