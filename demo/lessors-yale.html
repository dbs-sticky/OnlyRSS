          <p>
            Ascend by Cirium’s Values Review Board has reviewed most of the significant aircraft families over the past three months and positive value changes are reflected in the Airbus A320ceo, Boeing 737NG and Max, and 787 families. The estimated aggregate market values of most lessor portfolios are, as a consequence, reflecting positive changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the macro demand outlook for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 looks increasingly  uncertain, continued recovery in Asia-Pacific and China is likely to see positive pressures  continue for now and the overall asset value outlook thus remains rosy at present.
          </p>
          <p>
            When lessors’ share of the global commercial aircraft fleet hit the <em>50%</em> mark amid the Covid crisis, it seemed a symbolic milestone had been reached. Now, some commentators think this heralds an era of market dominance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Briefing analysts on 11 August, AerCap chief executive Aengus Kelly — long a believer in lessors’ ability to grow market share — observed that the trend was accelerating quicker than he had previously predicted.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <q>There is no question that leasing is growing much faster than I had expected before the pandemic. Between sale-leasebacks and direct lessor orders, we're probably looking at <em>65%</em> of all deliveries will end up in the leasing channels.</q> — Aengus Kelly
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Cirium data shows that lessors acquired <em>68%</em> of all new deliveries in 2021, <em>29%</em> from direct lessor orderbook and <em>39%</em> via purchase and leaseback. But for the first half of 2022 that has eased to <em>56%</em>, with <em>28%</em> direct orders and <em>28%</em> purchase and leaseback accounted for by lessors.
          </p>
          <p>
          A banking source, with a focus on Africa, notes that several flag carriers on that continent have shifted from an ownership to a leasing model recently as there have been <q>less bank cheques from governments to airlines</q>.
          </p>
          <p><q>Pre-Covid, many of the flag carriers in Africa were very fixed on ownership at all costs, and I think many of them have started to realise that is a more challenging thing in the post-Covid environment.</q>
          </p>


          <p>
            He points to the decision by Angolan flag carrier TAAG to lease six new Airbus A220s from Air Lease, disclosed during the Farnborough show in July, and Air Senegal’s November 2021 signing of an agreement with Macquarie AirFinance to lease five new A220-300s.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <q>I think one of the real reasons [for this] is that the equity contribution, which would previously in those circumstance have come from government, has been less forthcoming as I think governments have perhaps used their resources first to rebuild economies off the back of lockdown.</q>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            But he believes this trend will likely be temporary. As African economies recover, governments will once again have resources to back their national carriers to purchase deliveries with cash.
