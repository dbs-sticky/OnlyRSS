#### What is OnlyRSS?

OnlyRSS is a collection of articles that exist only in the RSS feed itself. There's no CMS used for article creation\storage, and there's no website where articles can be viewed. The articles can only be viewed in RSS Aggregators such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com) and [Inoreader](http://inoreader.com). If you have any comments on this article, or any questions about OnlyRSS, then please ask me (Mark Evans) via [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/dbs_sticky)
