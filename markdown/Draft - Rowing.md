## Background

I bought my Concept 2 Model C rower in 2001, my plan (like most people who buy exercise equipment) was to use it every week. And, like most people,I failed. I used the rower sporadically for a while, and then I moved house, and it just sat there in my new home, gathering dust. I'd get the urge to start using it again (yes...January) and as usual, it didn't last. I've always done some form of exercise, either in the gym or running, and have had some long periods of running every week (maybe up to a year at a time), I've run about ten 1/2 Marathons and one full Marathon. But I don't think I've ever exercised consistently every week for a period longer than a year.

## 2014 - New Year's day

This all changed when I hit 40. My daily routine was basically, driving to work, sitting at my desk for 8hrs (or standing in my lab), driving home, then after I'd made dinner and picked up after the kids, I'd sit in front of the tv with the wife for an hour or so before bed. Not exactly an active lifestyle. So I made a New Year's resolution to row at least 30km every week (4x5km, 1x10km). I used Excel and made a big table where each row was a week, and each column was 5km (it had 10 columns, so 50km). I printed the table on A3 paper, and stuck it up on the wall in the garage, right next to the rowing machine. The aim was simple, "don't break the streak", the longer I could hit 30km each week, the less likely I would be to miss a week, because I'd "break the streak". I had to start off slowly, but by week 3 I was up to 30km, and with the exception of a few weeks (house move, and a work trip to NYC) I hit my target. But the table was not the thing that kept me going, 30km per week on the rower meant about 2 1/4 hrs of my time, and just rowing can be boring. To help alleviate the boredom I attached my iPad to the rower, got some sports headphones, and started watching Star Trek (original) from the very beginning. Exercise time was now also Star Trek time. When I got to the end of Star Trek, I watched Stargate SG1, all 10 seasons, and then Atlantis, and then.....you get the idea. I watched TV that I would look forward to. During September I hit 1'000'000 meters, and as I'd been logging my rows in the Concept 2 online log book, I qualified for my free 1million meter t-shirt and pin.

## 2015

2015 carried on much like 2014, 30km per week (this time I didn't miss any weeks). I hit 2million meters in May (you don't get any freebies for 2million) and I also rowed my first 20km. I did my first 1/2 Marathon in July, and then my 2nd in December, when I also hit 3million meters.

## 2016 - This is the year when I realised I had been lazy

There were three things that happened in 2016 that made me realise that I needed to up my game:

1. I set a New Year's resolution to row a Marathon by the end of the year.
2. I read Row Daily, Breathe Deeper, Live Better: A Guide to Moderate Exercise.
3. A friend of mine casually mentioned that she swam for an hour every day.

2016 started well, with my 3rd 1/2 Marathon in January, but by week 6 my long running streak was broken, due to a case of man-flu that lasted more than 2 weeks. There followed another couple of 1/2 Marathons during the year. But, it was points 2) and 3) that eventually led me to reassess my rowing goal of 30km per week, and this happened in August. I was already doing a lot of what was discussed in "Row Daily, Breathe Deeper, Live Better: A Guide to Moderate Exercise", but it was only when I got to the chapter on case studies that it suddenly occurred to me that the book was targeted at old people (ok, at this time I was 43...but I mean really old people, as in 60+). All the case studies were of people in their 60s and 70s. So, here was me thinking that my 30km per week was pretty good, and here's this book encouraging people in their 70s to row 70km per week! Combined with my friend doing an hour swim every day, I realised that it was time to up my game. So, during August I set a new goal of 70km per week (typically 7x10km). I rowed my first Marathon in November (3hr12m53.6s, 2:17/500m,), and hit 5million meters in the first week of January (finally...a new t-shirt and pin).

## Summary

Rowing is now part of my lifestyle, it's fully integrated into my daily routine. I'm not trying to break records (obviously, I'm watching tv at the same time), but I am trying to make up for the 8hrs a day I spend sitting at a desk, and to be honest, 10km per day is probably only just managing that. I'm still setting myself goals so I don't get too comfortable.

## My tips

- There's nothing harder than getting home from work, and then dragging your arse back out again to go to a gym. **If you can, buy a rower**, a Concept 2 will hold its value really well (during the pandemic my 20yr old rower was worth only about 20% less than I paid for it!) it holds its value well, and will last forever.
- Set a goal, print out a table/chart, and mark off each row, start a streak, and try to keep it going.
- Attach a tablet to the rower, or set up a TV and watch some sci-fi (other genres are acceptable), or listen to podcasts or audio books, but do something that will keep your mind occupied.
- Put some padding on the seat, those things are not meant for long rows!
- Log your rows with the Concept 2 Logbook, the rewards might not be much, but I wear my t-shirt with pride.

None of this is groundbreaking, obviously, but maybe it could help a few people dust off their Concept 2s
