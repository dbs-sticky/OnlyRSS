# Background 
I didn't used to read. Don't get me wrong, I had books, almost enough to fill a shelf (it was a mix of physics text books and a small but treasured collection of Calvin & Hobbes) but I wasn't a "reader". I didn't go to bed with a book, and picking up a book during the day was not part of my routine.

This all changed about 7 years ago when I made a deal with a colleague, if she watched the TV show Firefly, then I'd read a book that she had recommended. I read that book on a Kindle, and I have barely put the Kindle down since. I'm not saying that I only kept up the habit of reading because of the Kindle, but I'm not sure I would have carried on if I had to order books, wait for them to arrive, and then struggle to read them in the dark while the wife tried to go to sleep next to me.

The first device I bought was the Paperwhite, then I passed that onto the wife and I got a newer version of the Paperwhite, and a while later I bought an even newer
# Benefits
## 1. The built in dictionary
Unlike Donald Trump, I don't <em>know all the words</em>, so being able to press my fingertip on a word and see the definition is great. Even more useful than the dictionary is the etymology, I find that learning how a word came to be helps me to remember its definition.
## 2. The backlight
I mostly read in bed, and unlike my wife, I don't fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow, so the backlight on the Kindle is essential for me. On the Oasis as you can change the colour temperature and switch to dark mode (i.e. light text on a dark background). 

## 3. The clock!
Ok, this one might seem a bit silly, but as I read when I go to bed, it's useful for me to keep an eye on the time, otherwise I might find myself reading well into the small hours. Like many people these days I don't have a clock in the bedroom as a rely on my phone. Having the clock on the Kindle stops me periodically reaching for my phone.
## 4. Saving quotes
Not so important when reading fiction (which represents about 80% of what I read), but when I do venture into the world of non-fiction, I often like to save quotes or other useful sections of text so I can easily find them again later. This is a feature of the Kindle that often gets overlooked.
## 5. Kindle Unlimited
Kindle Unlimited in the UK costs Â£7.99 pm and includes more than 650,000 books that can be borrowed (up to 20 at a time). I'm probably reading 2-3 books per month via Kindle Unlimited, so for me it makes financial sense.

## 6 Whisper sync
This is Amazon's name for the feature that lets you sync your reading progress across Kindle devices and Kindle apps. When I find myself in the car waiting for one of my kids to finish [insert name of activity that seems really important to them now but they will quit once they become a teenager here], then I'll often fire up the Kindle app on my phone, and start reading where I'd finished off the night before.

## Space
You can fit more than 2,000 books on an 8GB Kindle, which is redonkulous. I typically have no more than 2 books downloaded to my device, the one I'm currently reading, and the one I'll be reading next. For those who don't like to hoard stuff in their homes (like me), a Kindle is a great space saver.
