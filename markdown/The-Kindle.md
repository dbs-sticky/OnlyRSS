I didn't used to read. Don't get me wrong, I had books, almost enough to fill a shelf (it was a mix of physics text books and a small but treasured collection of Calvin & Hobbes) but I wasn't a "reader". I didn't go to bed with a book, and picking up a book during the day was not part of my routine.

This all changed about 7 years ago when I made a deal with a colleague, if she watched the TV show Firefly, then I'd read a book that she had recommended. I read that book on a Kindle, and I have barely put the Kindle down since. I'm not saying that I only kept up the habit of reading because of the Kindle, but I'm not sure I would have carried on if I had to order books, wait for them to arrive, and then struggle to read them in the dark while the wife tried to go to sleep next to me.

The first device I bought was the Paperwhite, then I passed that onto the wife and I got a newer version of the Paperwhite, and a while later I bought an even newer generation Paperwhite, and the kids got my original, and the wife got my second device. Then, last year, I was reading so much I decided to treat myself, and I got the Kindle Oasis.
