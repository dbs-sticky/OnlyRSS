# Every Product Manager should build a website

I've used very specific wording in the title of this post. The key word in the title is **build**, I specifically don't state that every product manager should have a website, or write a blog, I don't even think it's that important if Product Managers actually publish the website's they build, but I do believe that all Product Managers (ok, not all, only those who are responsible for software products) should go through the process of building a web site. Why? well, like many of my suggestions, it all comes back to Ben Franklin ([or maybe Confucius](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/27/tell/)) and the following quote:

> Tell me and I forget,
> Teach me and I remember,
> Involve me and I learn.

The reason I like this quote so much, (and refer to it so often) is because I really believe it. It's the reason this website exists, I wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn't start with a book or a course...I started by building a page. This meant I made a lot of mistakes initially, mistakes I wouldn't have made if I'd started with a book, but I find that mistakes are hard to forget, whereas it's easy to forget a description in a book of how to do something correctly.

OK, but what does this have to do Product Managers building websites, aren't there developers for that? To help answer this question, I'd propose a small addition to the above quote i.e.

> Tell me and I forget,
> Teach me and I remember,
> Involve me and I learn\understand\appreciate.

Learning something is great, and I've really enjoyed learning how to build this website, but, it's also had a couple of side effects:

1. I have a much better **understanding** of what my development team does.
2. I have a much better **appreciation** for what my development team does.

Before I go any further, let me make one thing clear, _I am not in any way comparing my tiny blog to the products that my developers build_. This website and the products I manage are so far apart in scale and complexity that it would be laughable to even compare them.
